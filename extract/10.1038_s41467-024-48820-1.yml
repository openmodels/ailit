Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate physical risk
  2: Climate physical risks (acute risks from climate-related hazards like hurricanes,
    and chronic risks from long-run climate impacts) at the asset level.
  3: Climate physical risks, both acute (tropical cyclones) and chronic (not specified
    on this page but inferred from context); use of firm headquarters as a proxy for
    asset location; neglecting acute risk.
  4: Acute shocks such as RP250 losses and chronic shocks from macroeconomic models
    are drivers of risk.
  5: Tropical cyclones; Climate physical risks (acute and chronic); Neglecting asset-level
    information
  6: Acute shocks (asset-level losses due to hazards) and chronic shocks (sectoral
    output losses) stemming from climate change.
  8: Physical risks from climate change, specifically tropical cyclones under different
    Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios (2.6, 4.5, 6.0).
  9: Tropical cyclones, measured by wind speed.
  10: Chronic risks (impacts on output trajectories of business lines) and acute risks
    (location and characteristics of assets impacted by tropical cyclones) due to
    climate change.
  11: Impacts from tropical cyclones, considering chronic and acute physical risks,
    are examined as factors affecting financial outcomes.
  12: Tropical cyclones.
Highlights:
  1: Asset-level assessment of climate physical risk matters for adaptation finance
  2: Neglecting the asset-level and acute dimensions of physical risks leads to large
    errors in the identification of adaptation policy responses, investments and finance
    tools aimed to build resilience to climate change.
  3: Using firm headquarters as a proxy for asset location significantly underestimates
    climate-related losses. Neglecting acute risks also significantly underestimates
    financial losses. The methodology enables investors and corporations to better
    integrate climate physical risks in their internal risk assessment and risk management
    processes.
  4: The study finds significant underestimation of investor losses when neglecting
    tail acute risks, with risks underestimated by up to 82.2% when only considering
    chronic risks.
  5: Neglecting asset-level data leads to a significant underestimation of financial
    risk and losses from climate physical risks; Asset-level information is key for
    climate physical risk assessment.
  6: Diversified firms experience both acute and chronic shocks depending on revenue
    shares and geolocations. Firms can have similar chronic shocks but very different
    acute shocks due to geolocalization. Firms can have large acute shocks even if
    operating in different sectors. Firms can be affected by similar large acute shocks
    but different chronic shocks.
  8: The study quantifies the underestimation of portfolio losses when using proxy
    data instead of asset-level data. The underestimation range can be significant,
    indicating that proxy data may fail to capture a substantial portion of the risk.
  9: Quantifies the macroeconomic impacts of climate change-induced tropical cyclones
    on Mexico's GDP using the ICES model under different SSP-RCP scenarios.
  10: Long-term climate physical risks are not accounted for in current valuations.
    The paper provides a methodology to adjust equity valuations to account for the
    impact of climate change, focusing on the long-run growth rate of dividends. The
    results are considered conservative due to data complexities, potential positive
    macroeconomic shocks, and the focus on tropical cyclones only.
  11: The adjusted equity values indicate potential impacts of climate scenarios and
    physical risks on firm valuation.
  12: The paper focuses on direct impacts of tropical cyclones, considering only one
    country (Mexico), one hazard (tropical cyclones), a selection of asset types (mostly
    energy-related), and one financial asset class (equities).
Methodology:
  1: Asset-level assessment
  2: A methodology for asset-level climate physical risk assessment that translates
    the impact of both acute and chronic risk on the financial value of firms with
    productive assets exposed to climate impacts, and on financial securities (equity)
    associated with those firms. Applied to 177 listed firms in Mexico owning 1820
    physical assets.
  3: 'A five-step methodology is used: 1) database of asset-level data, ownership
    chain, and financial information; 2) probabilistic climate acute risk assessment
    using the CLIMADA model; 3) connection of acute impacts with sector-level chronic
    impacts using a macroeconomic model (ICES); 4) connection of asset-level impacts
    with firm performance using a Climate Dividend Discount Model (CDDM); 5) translation
    of climate physical risks into financial risk metrics for investors. The equity
    value of the firm is computed considering future chronic and acute risks and compared
    with the result of computation using only current levels of risks to determine
    the equity shock.'
  4: The analysis uses an asset-level probabilistic climate risk assessment approach,
    combining climate impacts at the asset level with macroeconomic impacts using
    models such as the Intertemporal Computable Equilibrium System (ICES).
  5: Equity valuation adjustments are performed using both asset-level data and proxy
    data (firm headquarters location) to compare losses; Portfolio losses are computed
    using asset-level data versus proxy data; The Value at Risk (VaR) is computed
    and compared using both asset-level and proxy data
  6: A climate dividend discount model (CDDM) is used. The framework uses geolocalized
    climate data for climate finance analysis. Acute shocks represent asset-level
    losses, and chronic shocks represent sectoral output losses weighted by revenues.
    The results are shown for the SSP3-RCP4.5 scenario for the year 2040.
  8: The analysis uses the CLIMADA model to perform a probabilistic assessment of
    damages from tropical cyclones at each asset location. It considers asset-level
    and firm-level losses, incorporating transmission channels and implications of
    climate physical risk on firms' business lines. The database model collects extra-financial,
    climate, and financial information of individual physical assets and firms. Confidence
    intervals are computed using the bias-corrected and accelerated percentile method
    over 15,000 samples.
  9: Uses the ICES model to quantify macroeconomic impacts of climate change, with
    SSP-RCP combinations at 5-year steps until 2070, but focuses on 2035, 2040, 2045,
    and 2050 horizons. A Climate Dividend Discount Model (CDDM) is developed to quantify
    climate physical risk adjustments on equity valuation.
  10: 'The paper develops a climate-dependent dividend discount model (CDDM) to estimate
    the impact of climate change physical risks on firm equity value. It modifies
    a standard dividend discount model by incorporating climate change impacts on
    long-run growth rates. The model considers a three-stage dividend estimation process:
    explicit estimation by a data provider, linear decline modeling, and terminal
    value estimation. It applies firm- and business line-specific loss due to acute
    risk conditioned to climate change impact scenarios.'
  11: The analysis involves computing equity valuation adjustments using expected
    annual impact (EAI) and RP250 quantiles from the CLIMADA model, applied to firm-level
    data with scenarios from 2022 to 2050.
  12: The methodology builds on relevant literature and relies on interpolation. It
    uses the CDDM (likely Climate Data and Model). The analysis is applied to quantify
    damages around the middle of the century.
More Notes:
  1: The paper is published in Nature Communications.
  2: Commercial methodologies for assessing climate physical risks are proprietary,
    not fully transparent, not fully replicable, and often lead to diverging results.
    They also provide climate risk scores with different levels of aggregation (e.g.,
    by firm or hazard) that cannot be used as a proxy for the asset-level damages
    needed to inform climate financial valuation models and climate financial risk
    pricing.
  4: The analysis suggests that both chronic and acute climate shocks contribute substantially
    to equity shocks, with a focus on tail risks being crucial for accurate risk assessment.
  5: The analysis considers both acute and chronic physical risks. The results are
    conditional on the specifications related to the characteristics of the assets.
  6: "The study acknowledges limitations, including uncertainty around the quantification\
    \ of tropical cyclone impacts, use of the same damage function across all asset\
    \ types, and not considering firms\u2019 adaptation efforts."
  8: The study focuses on energy-related or energy-intensive assets. The database
    links physical assets to firms, their business lines, and ultimately, equity valuation.
    It includes assets located in Mexico and reconstructs the chain of ownership to
    link assets to listed owners and financial contracts. The analysis is conducted
    for the year 2040 under the SSP3-RCP4.5 scenario.
  9: The study uses historical cyclone data from 1950-2021 and simulates synthetic
    tracks to assess probabilistic risk. It also considers the impact of climate change
    on tropical cyclone frequencies and intensities using RCP scenarios 2.6, 4.5,
    and 6.0.
  10: "The paper acknowledges that the model is simplified and makes assumptions,\
    \ such as firms not benefiting from having physical assets less exposed to climate\
    \ risk. The parameter \u03B4, which captures the impact from tropical cyclones,\
    \ is floored at 1 and capped at 2."
  12: The paper acknowledges limitations including lack of data on firms' adaptation
    strategies, missing information on assets' location, ownership, value and residual
    life, and the exclusion of indirect impacts like supply chain disruptions.

Quantitative material:
  2: Investor losses are underestimated up to 70% when neglecting asset-level information,
    and up to 82% when neglecting tail acute risks.
  3: Approximation using headquarters location underestimates climate-related losses
    by up to 70% in terms of relative difference on Value at Risk (VaR). Neglecting
    acute risk can lead to underestimation of financial losses for investors up to
    about 82% in terms of relative difference on VaR. Tail risk losses (RP100) are
    at least ten times larger than Expected Annual Impacts (EAI) for 37% of assets
    under RCP2.6. RP250 losses are at least ten times larger than EAI for 73% of assets
    and five times larger than RP100 losses for 13% of assets under RCP4.5.
  4: Yes, the page includes quantitative information using models like RP250 and EAI
    losses for firm-level and portfolio-level impacts.
  5: Neglecting tail acute risks leads to underestimation of portfolio losses up to
    82.2%; Using proxy data instead of asset-level information leads to underestimation
    of VaR up to 70.8%; Magnitude of VaR is 3 to 5.5 times larger when computed using
    asset-level data with respect to using proxy data; Neglecting asset-level data
    leads to an underestimation of the portfolio VaR between 67.4% and 92.3% when
    not considering chronic risks, and between 58.0 to 70.8% when considering chronic
    risks; Neglecting the tail of acute risks leads to an under- estimation of losses
    up to 97.7%

    scenarios are quantified (e.g., Chronic shock: -2.53%, Acute shock: -13.94%).'
  8: Panel A presents portfolio-level results for EAI and RP250, both asset-level
    and proxy, as well as Chronic + EAI and Chronic + RP250. The estimates (%) and
    confidence intervals (%) are provided for each case under SSP3-RCP4.5 scenario
    for the year 2040. For example, EAI, asset-level (mean) is -0.085% (-0.16, -0.049),

    ranges (%), comparing tail acute (proxy, RP250) vs tail acute (asset-level, RP250)
    and Chronic and tail acute (proxy, RP250) vs Chronic and tail acute (asset-level,
    RP250).
