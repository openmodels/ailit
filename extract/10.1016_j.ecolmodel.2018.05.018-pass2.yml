Drivers of Risk:
  1: Spatially variable ocean acidification in the California Current; lower pH drives
    strongest declines in benthic species in southern regions.
  3: Ocean acidification due to increasing carbon emissions.
  6: Ocean acidification
  7: Ocean acidification (specifically pH changes) in the California Current.
  17: Changes in ocean pH (specifically pH-induced mortality) affecting biomass and
    subsequently revenue in fisheries.
  18: Changes in pH affecting demersal functional groups.
  21: Projected pH changes (ocean acidification), indirect food web effects, biomass
    trends in simulations
  22: Declines in pH due to ocean acidification (OA) impacting Dungeness crab biomass,
    which in turn impacts port revenue.
  23: Ocean acidification affecting fish stocks, particularly Dungeness crab, Pacific
    hake, and sablefish; changes in catch composition due to species decline.
  24: Ocean acidification within the California Current.
  31: The primary driver of risk considered is ocean acidification.
  32: Regional variations in ocean pH affecting marine life in the California Current.
  49: Changes in fleet-specific revenue driving port-level revenue changes.

Highlights:
  3: Ocean acidification leads to declines in species biomass, particularly in the
    southern region. The largest economic impacts on revenue, income, and employment
    are projected to occur from northern California to northern Washington State due
    to declines in Dungeness crab, which is driven by loss of prey.
  6: Ocean acidification impacts on fisheries are likely to be regionally different,
    based on localized changes in organism responses. The paper explores these spatially
    heterogeneous impacts at the port-level in the California Current.
  7: The study explores the potential consequences of ocean acidification for port
    revenue, income, and employment in US west coast communities, identifying areas
    where future research, monitoring, and management are needed.
  17: The study focuses on the sole influence of pH on fisheries revenue, removing
    the influence of other oceanographic changes (such as temperature).
  18: Demersal functional groups are most affected by changes in pH. Sixteen functional
    groups experienced biomass effect sizes of |0.20| or greater.
  21: Projected pH changes and indirect food web effects can substantially impact
    port revenue and revenue from specific fishery target groups. Dungeness crab revenue
    is projected to decline significantly at several ports due to these factors.
  22: Substantial declines in port-level revenue occurred at ports reliant on Dungeness
    crab and flatfish, particularly in Oregon and Northern California due to pH declines;
    Tillamook experienced the largest decline in revenue due to its high reliance
    on Dungeness crab; Employment effects can be more exaggerated than revenue impacts
    due to differences in income vs. employment multipliers.
  23: Ocean acidification can lead to declines in revenue, income, and employment
    in the fishing industry, with varying impacts depending on vessel type and port.
    Some vessel types and regions are more vulnerable than others. Nine of the ten
    vessel types will experience a decline > |0.2| in at least one port. Oregon and
    Washington (Brookings north) have the most detrimental effects from ocean acidification.
  24: The largest economic consequences of ocean acidification may occur for central
    and northern west coast ports that rely on demersal species for a large portion
    of fisheries catch.
  32: Significant economic impacts projected for ports reliant on Dungeness crab fishery
    due to biomass declines.
  49: The analysis focuses on changes in revenue, income, and employment at the port
    level and relates these changes to fleet-specific revenue.

Methodology:
  3: Uses an ecosystem model forced by oceanographic projections and coupled to an
    economic input-output model. The model explores one possible future of how ocean
    acidification may influence the coastline. The biological changes are for six
    coastal regions from Vancouver Island, Canada to Baja California, Mexico. The
    economic impacts are for 17 ports on the US west coast.
  6: The analysis employs oceanographic predictions from a Regional Oceanographic
    Modeling System (ROMS) model, forced by an earth system model (GFDL-ESM2M) under
    climate scenario RCP8.5, an Atlantis end-to-end marine ecosystem model, and an
    economic input-output model.
  7: An ecosystem model (Atlantis) is used to investigate the impacts of ocean acidification,
    with physical forcing from a fine-scale ocean model for the present and 50 years
    in the future. Outputs from Atlantis are passed to an economic input-output model
    (IO-PAC) to estimate economic impacts.
  17: A 100-year ecosystem model is run, and biomass values are averaged over the
    final 10 years. Revenue changes are calculated by multiplying biomass by price.
    Changes in biomass and revenue are reported only for effect sizes greater than
    |0.2|.
  18: IO-PAC model is used with multipliers for fisheries revenue and processor effect
    to consider direct, indirect, and induced effects on income and employment. Effects
    calculated for 2063 relative to a 2013 baseline.
  21: Atlantis simulations were used to project revenue from catch and compare with
    PacFIN records. The base scenario used data from 2013. A relative sensitivity
    (RS) metric was used to measure change in revenue.
  22: Analysis based on proportional reliance on different species for port revenue
    and how declines in certain species impact overall revenue, income, and employment;
    Use of income and employment multipliers by vessel type to determine broader economic
    impacts.
  23: A model was used to simulate the effects of ocean acidification on different
    vessel types and ports. The analysis uses a 100-year spinup to 2063 conditions.
    Port-level revenue is parsed by vessel type. The effects of ocean acidification
    are determined by changes in the catch composition of the vessels.
  24: Modeling framework using ROMS model, spatially explicit ecosystem model, and
    spatially resolved fishing revenues used in an IO model. Scenario analysis approach
    used to explore possible future pathways.
  31: The authors suggest that Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models may be
    better for long-term projections of economic responses due to their ability to
    factor in changing prices and input substitutions.
  49: Analysis is performed at the port level and is based on 2013 landing data.
  52: No relevant information
More Notes:
  3: The model suggests long-term planning for communities, researchers and managers
    in the northern region of the California Current would benefit from tracking Dungeness
    crab productivity and potential declines related to pH.
  7: The economic analysis is focused on the US portion of the model due to data availability.
    The study uses data aggregated by the Pacific Fisheries Information Network (PacFIN)
    for 17 port groups on the outer coast of the US.
  17: The model focuses on large vulnerabilities, not fine-grained projections.
  18: Analysis focuses on functional groups with regional variability in biomass change.
  21: The Atlantis simulations did not accurately represent 2013 landings for all
    ports, particularly those with species that declined in abundance in baseline
    simulations. Market squid revenue is projected to increase in Southern California
    ports.
  22: Some ports experienced relief from Dungeness crab declines with increases in
    pandalid shrimp revenue.
  31: The study acknowledges limitations in its biological assumptions, including
    looking at ocean acidification as a single stressor and assuming pH only affects
    mortality.

Quantitative material:
  3: Declines in species biomass tend to be larger in the southern region of the model,
    but the largest economic impacts on revenue, income and employment occur from
    northern California to northern Washington State.
  6: No direct quantitative material on macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes is provided,
    but it does mention that the direct ex-vessel revenue from fisheries in the US
    portion of the California Current ecosystem was worth over $450 million in 2012.
  7: The study simulates changes in catch, revenue, income, and employment for 17
    US port groups.
  17: Effect size on revenue is calculated as the difference between revenue under
    2063 conditions with and without pH mortality, standardized by 2013 revenue.
  18: Biomass effect sizes of |0.20| or greater were experienced by sixteen functional
    groups. Economic effects are calculated as the difference between scenarios in
    2063 and standardized by 2013Baseline.
  21: "Simulated revenue per port ranged from 0.4 \u2013 1.48 (mean 1.07, SD 0.39).\
    \ Declines in Dungeness crab revenue had effect sizes between -0.42 and -1.0+\
    \ at nine U.S. ports north of Fort Bragg, CA. Some ports experienced a 0.3 increase\
    \ in revenue from pandalid shrimp."
  22: Effect size of -0.27 from declines in Petrale sole for seven ports; effect size
    of -0.39 from declines in Dover sole for three ports; Revenue Proportion (RP)
    > |0.2| for ports relying on Dungeness crab and flatfish; Tillamook experienced
    the largest decline in revenue as a result of declines in pH due to Dungeness
    crab, which made up 97.3% of revenue in 2013Baseline; In PacFIN Dungeness crab
    made up 86.3% of revenue for Tillamook in 2013.
  23: Employment declined more strongly (0.71) than revenue and income (0.58 and 0.59)
    for Crabbers when revenue was reduced in one port. In another port, impacts across
    revenue (-0.37), income (-0.36), and employment (-0.37) were similar.
  31: The study notes that IO model estimates of impacts on employment and income
    did not substantially differ from changes in revenue.
  49: Changes in revenue, income, and employment are binned by 0.10, and changes with
    an absolute value less than 0.20 are grey.
