Drivers of Risk:
  1: Extreme climate shocks, specifically the 2008 snow disaster in China, impact
    green agricultural development by altering farmers' production decisions.
  2: Extreme climate shocks (specifically the 2008 snow disaster in China).
  3: Extreme climate shocks (e.g., snow disaster in China) impact agricultural production
    and farmers' decisions.
  4: Extreme weather shocks (snow disaster), scarcity of water resources, increasing
    future climate risks.
  6: Snow disaster (January 2008) driven by rainfall fluctuations (Rainsi).
  7: Rainfall fluctuations (total and in rainy season)
  8: Snow disaster (specifically, rainfall fluctuations in January 2008)
  9: Snow disaster
  10: Snow disaster (Rainsi x Postt).
  11: Snow disaster (exogenous climate shock), rainfall fluctuations, potential confounding
    factors like land transfer policies.
  12: "Extreme climate shocks, specifically snow disasters, have changed farmers\u2019\
    \ production behaviors."
  13: Snow disaster.
  14: Snow disaster
  15: Extreme climate shocks, specifically snow disasters, are impacting GAD.
  16: Snow disaster (extreme climate shock).
  17: Extreme climate shocks, specifically snow disasters, impact farmers' risk expectations
    and agricultural practices.
  18: Extreme climate shocks; Snow disaster (specifically the 2008 snow disaster in
    China).
Highlights:
  1: Extreme climate shocks are detrimental to green agricultural development, affecting
    it more in humid and developed regions, and influence farmers' willingness to
    cultivate, energy consumption, and inputs like fertilizer and pesticides.
  2: "Extreme climate shocks impede Green Agricultural Development (GAD) in the long\
    \ term; extreme climates have a greater impact on GAD in humid zones and economically\
    \ developed areas; extreme climate shocks hinder GAD by reducing farmers\u2019\
    \ willingness to cultivate, increasing energy consumption in agricultural production,\
    \ and increasing fertilizer and pesticide inputs."
  3: Extreme climate shocks reduce agricultural output in the short term and increase
    long-term climate risks, leading to decreased agricultural income, reduced willingness
    to farm sustainably, increased energy consumption, and greater use of chemical
    inputs, ultimately lowering GAD.
  4: Extreme weather shocks reduce farmers' willingness to cultivate, increase agricultural
    energy consumption, and increase agricultural pollution, leading to a reduction
    in the level of Green Agricultural Development (GAD).
  6: "The coefficient \u03B21 represents the effect of the snow disaster on the dependent\
    \ variable greenit (GAD index)."
  7: The study suggests that whether a county is affected by snow disaster is unrelated
    to its economic characteristics, implying good stability in the treatment and
    control groups.
  8: The snow disaster had a statistically significant negative impact on the level
    of GAD.
  9: The snow disaster significantly reduced the level of the GAD index. Other control
    variables have little effect on the level of green agriculture except for agriculture-related
    variables. Parallel trend hypothesis is satisfied.
  10: Snow disaster has a significant negative impact on the GAD index.
  11: The snow disaster has a significantly negative impact on Green Agricultural
    Development (GAD). This finding is robust to controlling for land transfer policies,
    rainfall fluctuations, effective irrigation rate, and education. The PSM method
    confirms that the results are not due to sample self-selection bias.
  12: Snow disasters have a robust and significant negative impact on the level of
    Gross Agricultural Domestic product (GAD), interpreted as a measure of agricultural
    production consumption and pollution.
  13: The negative impact of the snow disaster on GAD does not come from the omitted
    random variables.
  14: The impact of snow disasters on GAD has significant heterogeneity in different
    climate regions. The inhibitory effect of snow disasters on GAD mainly occurs
    in areas with abundant rainfall. The impact of the snow disaster on the level
    of GAD is relatively moderate in poor counties.
  15: The impact of snow disasters on GAD is uniform across agricultural and non-agricultural
    counties but varies significantly by economic region.
  16: Snow disasters significantly reduce the utilization rate of cultivated land
    and increase energy consumption in agricultural production.
  17: While agricultural product output increases after a snow disaster, their quality
    declines, leading to a decrease in their value.
  18: Extreme climate shocks hinder GAD; Impact is heterogeneous across climate and
    economic zones; Extreme climate shocks reduce GAD by affecting farmers' income
    and expectations and agricultural product quality; Government subsidies and agricultural
    insurance can mitigate the negative impacts.
Methodology:
  1: The study uses the difference-in-difference method to assess the impact of extreme
    climate shocks on green agricultural development.
  2: Difference-in-difference (DID) method based on the degree of damage to each county
    during the 2008 snow disaster.
  3: The study uses a difference-in-difference method (DID) to assess the causal effect
    of extreme climate shocks on GAD, constructing a GAD index through the entropy
    weight method.
  4: Difference-in-difference model to analyze the impact of snow disaster on the
    level of GAD; Entropy weighting method (EWM) to calculate a comprehensive index
    of the level of GAD. The analysis is applicable to understanding the short-term
    impacts of extreme weather events on agricultural production and the willingness
    to adopt green agriculture practices.
  6: Difference-in-Differences (DID) approach is used to estimate the effect of the
    snow disaster on a 'Green Agricultural Development' (GAD) index. The rainfall
    fluctuation is used as a continuous variable to identify the degree of the disaster.
    County-level and time-fixed effects are included in the model.
  7: The study uses a treatment/control group comparison based on rainfall fluctuations
    during a snow disaster in January 2008. The treatment group consists of counties
    where rainfall fluctuations were above the median (0.3).
  8: Difference-in-differences (DID) estimation using rainfall fluctuations in January
    2008 as a proxy for the snow disaster impact, comparing affected and non-affected
    counties before and after the event. Baseline estimations cover county-level fixed
    effects, time fixed effects, and control variables like population, agricultural
    machinery power, industry value-added, and government expenditure.
  9: Baseline regression analysis with control variables, individual fixed effects,
    and time fixed effects. Difference-in-differences (DID) method with parallel trend
    test. Robustness checks, including adding a time trend.
  10: Difference-in-differences estimation, controlling for time trend, municipalities,
    land transfer policy, climatic factors (Rainfall1, Rainfall2), individual fixed
    effects, and time fixed effects. Sample period is 2000-2018.
  11: Difference-in-differences (DID) regression, Propensity Score Matching (PSM),
    Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS). The analysis is performed on county-level data
    in China from 2000-2018, focusing on the impact of the 2008 snow disaster.
  12: The analysis employs difference-in-differences (DID) methodology and instrumental
    variable (IV) estimation with 2SLS using 2007 rainfall fluctuations and geographical
    locations as instruments.
  13: Difference-in-differences (DID) variable is constructed on randomly selected
    treatment and control groups of provinces to perform a placebo test, repeated
    500 and 800 times. This is intended to test whether the baseline results were
    caused by omitted random variables.
  14: Heterogeneity analysis based on climate zone (humid, semi-humid, semi-arid)
    and poverty level (poor vs. non-poor counties), using a regression model with
    fixed effects. Results are applicable to China.
  15: The analysis involves dividing counties by industrial structure (agricultural
    vs. non-agricultural) and economic development (eastern, middle, western) and
    measuring the impact of snow disasters on GAD using coefficients.
  16: Regression analysis using panel data (counties over time) with individual fixed
    effects, and time fixed effects. The effect of the snow disaster is estimated
    by the coefficient of the interaction term between 'Rainsi' (likely rainfall intensity)
    and 'Postt' (likely a post-snow disaster indicator).
  17: The study uses the logarithm of fertilizer and pesticide input per hectare as
    a mechanism variable for analysis to assess agricultural pollution mechanisms,
    and considers the total output of major agricultural products as well as primary
    industry value-added as dependent variables.
  18: Difference-in-difference method; Applicable in the context of China and the
    2008 snow disaster.
More Notes:
  2: The paper uses the entropy weight method (EWM) to calculate the composite indicators
    of GAD.
  3: The paper acknowledges a lack of existing literature directly studying the impact
    of extreme climate shocks on GAD.
  4: The study uses rainfall fluctuations during the snowstorm in January 2008 as
    a proxy variable for the degree of disaster.
  6: The paper uses a sample of 2086 counties in China from 2000 to 2018. Control
    variables include total population (POP), agricultural machinery power (Machinery),
    primary industry value-added (First), secondary industry value-added (Second),
    total government expenditure (Expand), and total social investment (Invest).
  7: The focus is on a snow disaster and rainfall fluctuations and their effect on
    agricultural variables, not macroeconomic or macro-fiscal variables at the national
    level. The study area is in China.
  8: The study finds that total population, secondary industry value-added, and total
    social investment are not significant in affecting GAD.
  10: Analysis excludes municipalities of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing
    as a robustness check. Land transfer policy is controlled for as a concurrent
    event.
  11: The study uses various econometric methods to address potential confounding
    factors and biases, strengthening the validity of its findings. The analysis focuses
    on the impact of a single climate shock (snow disaster) on a specific sector (agriculture).
  13: The sample includes 2086 counties from 31 provinces in China, of which seven
    provinces were the most affected in the 2008 snow disaster.
  15: The snow disaster had no effect on the GAD index in the western region due to
    different agricultural dependency.
  16: The paper investigates the mechanisms through which climate shocks impact agricultural
    practices, with the implication that these changes can affect broader economic
    development (GAD - potentially 'Gross Agricultural Domestic product', or a measure
    of regional economic disparity).
  18: The study focuses on the agricultural sector in China; Policy recommendations
    include investing in agricultural infrastructure, tailoring agricultural policies
    to local conditions, providing agricultural disaster insurance, and subsidizing
    green production.
