Drivers of Risk:
  2: Human-induced climate change (warming, changes in precipitation patterns, increased
    frequency and severity of extreme events); Ethiopia's heavy dependence on rain-fed
    agriculture; high population growth rate; intense pressure on soil, water, and
    biodiversity resources from population growth and inappropriate traditional farming
    and management practices; increased frequency and intensity of droughts; increases
    in floods.
  3: No relevant information
  4: Climate change impacts are the drivers of risk, specifically in relation to agricultural
    livelihoods.
  6: Hazards that communities must manage; Climate change impacts affecting agroecosystems.
  8: Perceived changes in temperature, precipitation (amount, timing, and variability),
    and frequency of extreme events (floods and droughts) by farmers.
  9: Climate change impacts on agriculture in the Choke Mountain watersheds.
  10: Human-induced land degradation, changes in crop suitability due to climate change.
  11: Limited access to natural capital (land and water), physical capital (technology,
    markets), and specific agroecosystem conditions are identified as drivers of vulnerability.
    Specifically, limited water availability, indicated by low irrigation rates despite
    available resources, impacts household resilience.
  12: Varying agroecosystems influencing adoption of agricultural technologies
  14: No relevant information
  16: Climate variability and change, population growth, inappropriate traditional
    farming and management practices, extensive cultivation, overgrazing, deforestation,
    soil erosion, soil fertility decline, water scarcity, livestock feed shortages,
    fuel wood needs, extreme weather events, uncertainty in climate forecast (precipitation
    amount, timing, and intensity), uncertainty regarding future socio-economic states.
Highlights:
  3: No relevant information
  4: Single, national-level agriculture adaptation strategies cannot work in a biophysically
    or socially diverse country; a community by ecosystem-based approach has significant
    potential for building climate resilience.
  6: Resilience varies greatly for different groups within a community. Adaptive capacity
    of individuals, households and communities is shaped by access to and control
    over natural, human, social, physical, and financial resources.
  8: Farmers perceive increasing temperatures and changing rainfall patterns; a significant
    proportion of farmers are taking adjustment measures.
  9: Farmers in the Choke Mountain watersheds have adopted various adjustment measures
    to climate change. Adaptive capacity is related to natural capital (land suitability,
    land degradation, water availability) among other capitals.
  10: Vulnerability is hypothesized to increase with crop suitability. AES 1 and AES
    5 are characterized by high land degradation. AES 3 is the most suitable for agriculture.
  11: The study highlights variations in resource access (land, water, technology)
    and practices (irrigation, fertilizer use) across different agroecosystems, impacting
    household livelihoods. Low irrigation rates and sub-optimal fertilizer application
    are key findings.
  12: Adoption of improved seeds varies significantly across agroecosystems in the
    Choke Mountains.
  14: No relevant information
  16: Sustainability of projects that take the natural resource base as an entry point
    has come into question because interventions often fail to establish a link to
    markets that is required to sustain efforts after the project comes to a close.
    Markets are a more appropriate entry point.
Methodology:
  3: The paper will present a framework for building resilience to climate change
    at a local level in the Blue Nile/Abay Highlands.
  4: A community by ecosystem-based approach is used, focusing on ecology, soil, and
    farming systems, and placing both human and natural systems at the center of analysis.
  6: Agro-ecosystem analysis considering geographical differentiation (climate, topography,
    soils, farming systems) and socio-economic stratification. Identification of major
    agroecosystems (AES) in the study area.
  8: Survey of farmers' perceptions of climate change in the Choke Mountain agro-ecological
    systems, compared to observed temperature data of the area.
  9: Regression analysis to identify indicators explanatory of adaptive capacity at
    the community level, using livelihood assets as a proxy. Vulnerability assessment
    across five agro-ecosystems (AESs) using socio-economic, climatic, and soil-related
    variables.
  10: Assessment of crop suitability and human-induced land degradation using FAO
    data, classified into suitability scores and degradation levels for different
    agroecosystems.
  11: The analysis uses sample surveys to assess household characteristics and resource
    use within different agroecosystems of the Choke Mountain Watersheds. Hypotheses
    are framed regarding the relationships between capital access and household potential.
  12: Descriptive statistics on the adoption of agricultural practices (irrigation,
    fertilizer, improved seeds) across different agroecosystems.
  14: No relevant information
  16: Community-Based Adaptation (CBA) development projects implemented in Choke Mountain
    watersheds, focusing on empowering vulnerable people and preserving the natural
    resource base. Participatory analysis of biophysical vulnerability is used to
    identify targeted strategies based on specific needs and priorities.
More Notes:
  3: The paper focuses on a local-level, community-based approach to adaptation in
    Ethiopia, and does not present nation-wide macro-fiscal analysis of adaptation.
  4: The CRGE initiative was started in November 2011 by the Government of Ethiopia.
  6: The study focuses on the Choke Mountain Watersheds in East Gojjam, Amhara National
    Regional State, Ethiopia. The AES classification supports agricultural policy
    makers and development experts.
  8: The study focuses on farmers' perceptions and adjustments at a local level (Choke
    Mountain) and does not directly link these to national-level macroeconomic or
    fiscal outcomes.
  9: The study focuses on a specific region (Choke Mountain Watersheds) in Ethiopia,
    limiting generalizability to a national level. The analysis focuses on adaptive
    capacity at the community level, not macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes directly.
  10: The analysis focuses on agroecosystems within the Choke Mountain watersheds.
  11: 'The focus is on micro-level vulnerabilities in a specific region, which could
    indirectly relate to macro-level effects if aggregated, but this paper doesn''t
    make that explicit connection. The study does not provide any cost benefit information. '
  12: The paper implicitly suggests that agroecosystem characteristics are related
    to adoption of beneficial farming practices; this may influence agricultural productivity
    and resilience to climate change.
  14: This page primarily focuses on community-level adaptation efforts in the Choke
    Mountain region, particularly regarding farmer participation in local environmental
    action plans and watershed management. It does not address nation-wide macroeconomic
    or macro-fiscal risks, costs, or benefits.
