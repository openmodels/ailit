Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increasing air temperature.
Highlights:
  1: The mean daily temperature in major Polish cities is increasing. This reduces
    heating demand and increases cooling needs. Climate warming affects the operation,
    energy source, driving force, capacity, and efficiency of renewable energy sources,
    with stronger effects on the demand side than the supply side. The investigated
    changes were favourable and unfavourable depending on the renewable technology
    and operation mode.
Methodology:
  1: "Statistical analysis of historical mean daily temperature observed in 19 major\
    \ Polish cities over the 1968\u20132018 period; qualitative analysis of the potential\
    \ impact of temperature trends on renewable energy sources."
More Notes:
  1: The paper focuses on the impact on renewable energy and energy demand, but does
    not directly quantify macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes at the national level.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: No relevant information
Quantitative material:
  1: "Mean daily temperature in major Polish cities is exhibiting a statistically\
    \ significant increasing trend, up to 0.52 \xB0C/decade (over the 1968-2018 period)."
