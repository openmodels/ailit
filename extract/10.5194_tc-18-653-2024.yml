Drivers of Risk:
  1: The primary drivers of risk are sub-shelf melting, ice discharge, surface mass
    balance (snowfall vs. runoff), ocean warming, and atmospheric warming.
  2: Increased glacier flow due to warm and salty circumpolar deep water (CDW) inducing
    sub-shelf melt; increased surface runoff due to rising atmospheric temperatures;
    hydrofracturing due to surface runoff on ice shelves.
  3: Uncertainties in Surface Mass Balance (SMB) and ocean-induced melt processes
    are the key drivers of risk to the Antarctic ice sheet's future trajectory.
  4: Changes in oceanic and atmospheric boundary conditions (temperature, salinity,
    precipitation, sublimation) derived from CMIP5 and CMIP6 climate models are used
    as forcing.
  5: Uncertainty in present-day Antarctic climate (SMB, air temperature, ocean temperature,
    salinity), uncertainty in climate forcing from CMIP6 models (MRI-ESM2-0, IPSL-CM6A-LR,
    CESM2-WACCM and UKESM1-0-LL), melt-elevation feedback (lapse rate), surface melt
    and runoff (degree day factors, thermally-active layer thickness), sub-shelf melting
    (basal melt parameterisations, ice-ocean heat flux sensitivity)
  7: "The parameters listed govern ice\u2013ocean and ice\u2013atmosphere interactions,\
    \ impacting sub-shelf melt parameterizations."
  8: Sub-shelf melting is implied as a driver of grounded-ice mass losses, particularly
    in the Amundsen Sea Sector Embayment (Thwaites Glacier area) and Aurora Basin
    in East Antarctica.
  9: Ice-ocean and ice-atmosphere interactions
  10: Retreat of Thwaites Glacier, warming under high-emission pathways leading to
    grounding-line retreat in marine basins (Wilkes and Aurora).
  13: Sub-shelf melt, calving fluxes, surface runoff, and changes in surface mass
    balance (SMB) driven by atmospheric and oceanic factors are identified as key
    drivers impacting ice sheet mass loss and sea-level rise.
  15: Projected Antarctic mass changes under very high-emission pathway, considering
    oceanic and atmospheric drivers.
  16: The primary drivers of Antarctic mass loss are oceanic forcing, atmospheric
    forcing, and the melt-elevation feedback.
  17: Oceanic forcing, atmospheric forcing (initially mitigating, then amplifying),
    melt-elevation feedback, ice-shelf collapse due to hydrofracturing, surface runoff.
  19: Rising air temperatures leading to increased surface runoff (both melt and rainfall),
    near-surface warming, ocean-driven ice thinning, snow accumulation.
  20: Ocean-driven retreat of Thwaites Glacier, which was triggered during the historical
    period, impacts the Antarctic ice loss outcomes.
  21: Sub-shelf melt fluxes, calving, surface mass balance fluxes, ice-ocean interactions,
    ice-atmosphere interactions, atmospheric warming, surface runoff, hydrofracturing,
    and meltwater discharge.
  22: Atmospheric warming, freshwater input from ice shelves modifying ocean conditions.
  23: The Shared Socio-economic Pathway (SSP) 5-8.5 is a driver of risk.
  24: Changes in ice-sheet elevation and area influence Antarctic mass balance projections.
    Uncertainties in ice-ocean-atmosphere interactions, sliding laws, basal hydrology,
    and Antarctic viscoelastic properties are considered drivers of risk.
  25: Ocean and atmospheric interactions driving ice loss, with ocean being the primary
    short-term mass loss driver.
  27: Near-surface air temperatures and precipitation rates are used as inputs to
    a positive degree-day (PDD) algorithm that calculates the surface mass balance
  32: No relevant information
  35: Antarctic ice loss due to climate change is primarily driven by factors such
    as basal melt rates, surface climate changes, and ice cliff instability.

  35: The paper discusses the response of the Antarctic ice sheet to climate change,
    including its mass loss and impacts on future sea-level rise.
Highlights:
  1: Ocean warming is the primary driver of short-term Antarctic mass loss. Atmospheric
    warming initially mitigates mass loss due to increased snowfall but becomes an
    amplifying driver under very high emissions due to increased surface runoff. Under
    a very high-emission scenario, the West Antarctic ice sheet is projected to collapse,
    with significant grounding-line retreat in East Antarctica.
  2: The future evolution of the Antarctic ice sheet is associated with large uncertainties,
    with models projecting both mass loss and mass gain by the end of the century.
    Increased surface runoff may compensate for mass gain through snowfall under very
    high-emission scenarios, but can also lead to ice-shelf thinning or collapse.
  3: Key uncertainties in ice-ocean and ice-atmosphere interactions significantly
    influence the projected behavior of the Antarctic ice sheet.
  4: No relevant information
  5: Parameter ranges were designed to be as wide as physically plausible.
  7: No relevant information
  8: The calibrated ensemble reproduces historical trends in ice-sheet mass change
    and its drivers. The observational constraints reduce uncertainty in the model
    hindcasts. Rapid grounded-ice mass losses are reproduced around the margins of
    the ice sheet, especially in the Amundsen Sea Sector and Aurora Basin.
  9: Presents historical simulations of Antarctic ice sheet mass balance components
    and compares them with observations; Shows spatial patterns of historical mass
    change (thickness change and rate of elevation change).
  10: Antarctic contribution to GMSLR is projected to increase significantly in the
    second half of the century, driven by the retreat of Thwaites Glacier. Under SSP5-8.5,
    a collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) is expected between 2300 and
    2500, and early-millennium warming likely commits the East Antarctic Ice Sheet
    to grounding-line retreat in its marine basins. Trajectories of GMSLR diverge
    significantly between SSP5-8.5 and SSP1-2.6 beyond the current century.
  13: 'Key phases for Antarctic mass loss under high emissions are identified: initial
    ocean-driven ice loss with sub-shelf melting, followed by decreased SMB and increased
    surface runoff post-21st century.'
  16: Oceanic forcing alone is projected to produce the highest median Antarctic contribution
    to GMSLR during the 21st century. Atmospheric forcing initially leads to mass
    gain due to increased snow accumulation. Both the WAIS and EAIS are affected,
    with WAIS potentially collapsing by the end of the millennium under both forcings.
  17: Antarctic mass loss under SSP5-8.5 is mainly driven by the combined effects
    of oceanic forcing and the melt-elevation feedback. The atmosphere initially mitigates
    this ocean-induced ice loss through enhanced snowfall, but transitions into an
    amplifying driver of mass loss. Ice-shelf collapse through hydrofracturing leads
    to higher median rates of contribution to global mean sea level rise (GMSLR),
    especially at the end of the century.
  19: "The mitigating potential of the Antarctic surface mass balance on sea-level\
    \ rise decreases significantly in the future due to increased surface runoff.\
    \ Warming above +7.5\xB0C leads to surface runoff surpassing snow accumulation\
    \ on the grounded ice sheet, and negative mass balance on the ice shelves."
  20: Emission scenario has limited influence on Antarctic ice loss by 2100; by 2300,
    West Antarctica experiences more severe ice loss than East Antarctica.
  21: The study projects a divergence in ice loss rates under different emissions
    scenarios around 2060-2080, with accelerated ice-sheet retreat under a very high-emissions
    scenario. Under a very high-emission scenario, surface runoff is projected to
    dominate the Antarctic mass balance by the end of the 23rd century.
  22: "Freshwater input from ice shelves may create a positive feedback loop, increasing\
    \ melt rates. The PDD-based projection of surface runoff demonstrates good agreement\
    \ with climate models. There may be a +7.5\xB0C warming threshold that leads to\
    \ reduced SMB."
  23: Compares surface runoff projections from the Bayesian calibrated ensemble with
    projections from MAR forced by CESM2, CNRM-CM6, and CESM2-WACCM under SSP 5-8.5.
  24: The study produced credible projections of future Antarctic mass balance by
    considering existing uncertainties and conditioning ensemble projections on relevant
    observations. Future work will involve applying a similar Bayesian calibration
    approach to a broader ensemble of simulations sampling uncertainties not exclusively
    focused on ice-climate interactions.
  25: Potential WAIS collapse by the end of the millennium under high-emission scenarios;
    early collapse likely due to oceanic and atmospheric interactions.
  29: This paper uses PICO and Plume models to estimate basal melt rates of ice shelves,
    using different input parameters.

  35: Contrasting responses between West and East Antarctic Ice Sheets to Glacial
    Isostatic Adjustment and contributions to sea-level rise under future climate
    conditions are key outcomes.
  42: Studies the variable temperature thresholds of melt pond formation on Antarctic
    ice shelves.
Methodology:
  1: The analysis uses an observationally-calibrated ice-sheet model forced by a panel
    of CMIP6 climate models. The results are applicable for projections up to the
    years 2100, 2300, and 3000.
  2: The information is based on observations and model projections of the Antarctic
    ice sheet evolution. The results apply to the end of the 21st century and beyond.
  3: An ensemble of simulations is run using the ice-sheet model Kori-ULB (previously
    called f.ETISh). A Bayesian calibration of the ensemble is performed by comparing
    model results with regional net mass balance estimates from IMBIE. Calibrated
    projections extend to the end of the millennium using atmospheric and oceanic
    projections inferred from a subset of models from CMIP6 under low and very high
    emission scenarios. Simulations are performed at a spatial resolution of 16 km.
    Surface melt and runoff are determined within the ice-sheet model using a simplified
    melt-and-runoff model.
  4: Ice-sheet simulations begin in 1950 CE, using an inverse simulation nudging towards
    present-day ice-sheet geometry for initial conditions. Hindcasts (1950-2014) use
    CMIP5 model NorESM1-M. From 2015, CMIP6 models (MRI-ESM2-0, IPSL-CM6A-LR, CESM2-WACCM,
    UKESM1-0-LL) are used as forcing until 2300, after which the climate is kept constant.
    SSP 5-8.5 and 1-2.6 scenarios are used. Atmospheric forcing is derived from monthly-averaged
    air temperature and sublimation anomalies, as well as precipitation ratios. Oceanic
    forcing uses yearly-averaged temperature and salinity anomalies. Anomalies are
    added to reference fields (present-day atmosphere and ocean climatologies).
  5: A perturbed parameter ensemble is designed including nine key parameters that
    govern processes at the ice-ocean-atmosphere boundary. Latin hypercube sampling
    is used to create the ensemble. Historical hindcast simulations from 1950-2014
    are performed, followed by projections under socio-economic pathways and constant
    present-day climate. Additional projections under SSP5-8.5 are produced for specific
    experiments.
  6: "The study uses Bayes\u2019 theorem to determine the posterior probability distribution\
    \ of uncertain input parameters for an ice sheet model, constrained by historical\
    \ regional net mass balance estimates from IMBIE (prior to 2015). A multivariate\
    \ Gaussian likelihood function is assumed, relating observed and simulated mass\
    \ balance estimates, with discrepancies considered independent and normally distributed.\
    \ Structural error is estimated by multiplying the observational error by a factor\
    \ of 10."
  7: "The analysis uses an uncertainty analysis with Latin hypercube sampling, applying\
    \ a factor (\u0393 eff) to the uncertainty range of a parameter associated with\
    \ sub-shelf melt parameterizations (M param)."
  8: The study uses the Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise (IMBIE; Otosaka
    et al., 2023) to provide observational constraints for Bayesian calibration of
    an ensemble of climate models. The calibrated ensemble is assessed against spatially-aggregated
    estimates of ice-sheet net mass balance, surface mass balance, sub-shelf melting,
    and iceberg calving fluxes from satellite- and modelling-based studies.
  9: 100-member ensemble of simulations using Latin hypercube sampling to explore
    uncertainties in ice-ocean and ice-atmosphere interactions; Bayesian calibration
    used to refine distributions based on observations.
  10: Calibrated ensemble (posterior distributions) of Antarctic mass changes is used
    to project future ice loss under SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios. Analysis extends
    until the end of the millennium (year 3000).
  15: Analysis of mean ice thickness change using Bayesian calibrated mean of a 100-member
    ensemble for specific experiments.
  16: The analysis separately considers the impacts of atmospheric forcing only, oceanic
    forcing only, both forcings without melt-elevation feedback, and atmospheric forcing
    without melt-elevation feedback.
  17: Calibrated ensemble simulations under SSP5-8.5. Hydrofracturing approximated
    following Pollard et al., 2015; DeConto and Pollard, 2016. Analysis focuses specifically
    on hydrofracturing and does not include the marine ice cliff instability (MICI)
    mechanisms.
  19: "Analysis based on GCM projections and examines the relationship between SMB,\
    \ snow accumulation, surface runoff, and regional warming (90-60\xB0S) over both\
    \ the grounded ice sheet and the ice shelves, projecting to 2300."
  20: "The analysis involves observationally-calibrated projections accounting for\
    \ key uncertainties in ice\u2013climate interactions, with long-term changes explored\
    \ beyond the year 2300."
  21: The study uses an ice sheet model initialized to match observations and calibrated
    against historical mass balance estimates. The analysis accounts for uncertainties
    in ice-ocean and ice-atmosphere interactions. Projections extend to 2300.  The
    analysis assumes surface meltwater is stored locally, potentially leading to ice-shelf
    collapse.
  22: Uses a PDD-based (Positive Degree Day) melt-and-runoff scheme, compares projections
    with MAR (regional climate model) and CESM2-WACCM (general climate model) outputs
    under SSP5-8.5. Applicable to multi-century timescales.
  23: "A Bayesian calibrated ensemble is used to project surface runoff rates. Ensemble\
    \ calibrated median, 25-75% and 5\u201395% probability intervals are shown (N=100\
    \ per SSP scenario), with a 5-year running average applied."
  24: Ensemble projections are conditioned on observations using a Bayesian calibration
    approach. A single ice-sheet model is used with uncertainties in boundary conditions,
    model physics, and numerical methods. CMIP6 climate model projections are used
    to force the ice-sheet model, but the authors acknowledge limitations of relying
    on a single model and the potential shortcomings of CMIP6 models. Observational
    estimates used for calibration are spatially integrated.
  25: "Use of an ensemble of simulations calibrated observationally, accounting for\
    \ uncertainties in ice\u2013ocean\u2013atmosphere interactions."
  26: Calving at the ice front is parameterized based on crevasse penetration depths.
  27: Surface mass balance is calculated using a positive degree-day (PDD) algorithm
    with monthly near-surface air temperatures and precipitation rates.
  28: The sub-shelf melt is modeled using the PICO model, which employs a parametrization
    approach based on buoyancy-driven advection of ocean water into ice-shelf cavities.
  29: Two models, PICO and a plume model, are used to estimate basal melt rates of
    ice shelves. The PICO model uses average ocean properties near the ice shelf cavities.
    The plume model uses a two-dimensional formulation (Lazeroms et al., 2019) based
    on the theory of buoyant meltwater plumes and far-field ocean measurements.
  30: Non-local quadratic parameterizations consider local circulation influenced
    by average thermal forcing over the ice-shelf basal surface.
  31: "Sector temperature corrections derived for MeanAnt median \u03B3 0 values are\
    \ used."
  32: Ice-sheet model simulations were performed using the Kori-ULB model to assess
    Antarctic mass balance. The CMIP6 forcing data and MAR outputs were used as inputs
    to the model. The specific Kori-ULB model version, simulations outputs and the
    scripts needed to produce the figures and tables are hosted on Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8398772).
    The MAR outputs used in this study are available on Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4459259;
    Kittel et al., 2021).
  35: The analysis includes uncertainty quantification, marine ice sheet model intercomparison,
    and evaluations of climate model outputs regarding Antarctic ice dynamics.
  42: "Uses RACMO2 model to model the climate and surface mass balance of Antarctica\
    \ (1979\u20132016)"
More Notes:
  1: The rate of sea-level rise is significantly reduced under a more sustainable
    socio-economic pathway, with mass loss likely remaining confined to the Amundsen
    Sea Embayment.
  3: The study uses a standalone ice-sheet model with independent atmospheric and
    oceanic boundary conditions due to computational constraints. The reliance on
    GCM outputs for future SMB involves drawbacks related to coarse resolution and
    representation of physical processes in polar regions. The melt-elevation feedback
    is considered as a source of bias in SMB projections.

  9: The ensemble mean grounding line and calving front positions are shown, reflecting
    how the model allows the calving front to evolve during the hindcast.
  10: Mass loss primarily occurs in the Amundsen Sea Embayment throughout the century
    under both scenarios. The spread in sea-level projections increases with time,
    especially under SSP5-8.5. Continued retreat of Thwaites Glacier is predicted
    even under constant present-day climate conditions.
  17: The oceanic forcing stands out as the primary trigger of mass loss in both West
    and East Antarctica.
  21: The study acknowledges the absence of a water-routing scheme and potential overestimation
    of surface melt-induced destabilization.
  22: The SSP5-8.5 scenario is considered very unlikely on multi-century timescales,
    and results under this scenario are presented as a maximum imagined outcome. The
    study acknowledges the omission of the melt-albedo feedback in the PDD approach,
    potentially leading to underestimation of runoff rates.
  24: The study acknowledges limitations due to the coarse spatial resolution and
    the fact that smaller bedrock irregularities and pinning points may be overseen.
    The authors used two different initial states.
  26: The Kori-ULB model's behavior aligns with high-resolution models in multi-model
    ensemble estimates, indicating model robustness.
