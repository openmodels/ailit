Drivers of Risk:
  2: Climate change impacts (accelerated warming, sea ice shrinkage, permafrost thawing)
    on social-economic systems in the Arctic, greater accessibility of Arctic hydrocarbons
    and bioresources, reduction of the heating period
  3: Permafrost thawing and its associated infrastructural damage, spread of infections,
    and transformation in natural disaster patterns.
  4: Global warming leading to Arctic ice melt, increased accessibility of Arctic
    resources
  6: Permafrost melting.
  7: Permafrost thawing due to climate change is impacting the ground bearing capacity,
    posing a risk to infrastructure and facilities built on it.
  8: No relevant information
  9: Permafrost degradation, reduction in ice period duration, melting of permafrost
    affecting extraction facilities, release of hazardous substances, and health risks
    from previously frozen diseases.
  13: Intensive climate change in the Arctic; Permafrost melting; Reduction of ice
    cover in the Arctic Ocean; Coastal erosion; Temperature and precipitation changes
  17: Climate change, permafrost degradation, ecological and climatic risks.
Highlights:
  2: Climate change in the Arctic presents both risks and opportunities for Russia's
    economy, necessitating a reassessment of regional development prospects and Arctic
    policy.
  3: Identification of key state policy areas to minimize uncertainty, manage climate
    risks, and exploit new opportunities in the Arctic region.
  4: Rapid ice melting opens up new transport and navigation opportunities in the
    Arctic region and increases accessibility of Arctic resources.
  6: Integrated assessment models often fail to account for the negative economic
    impacts of permafrost melting in Russia, leading to potentially inaccurate conclusions
    about the overall effects of climate change on the Russian economy.
  7: "By the middle of the twenty-first century, the zone of high risk of thawing\
    \ will cover many critical assets, including 1590 km of pipeline East Siberia\u2013\
    Pacific Ocean, 1260 km of pipelines in Yamal Nenets Autonomous Districts, and\
    \ 280 km of the railroad Obskaya-Bovanenkovo."
  8: No relevant information
  9: Permafrost melting affects transportation and extraction, releases hazardous
    materials, and increases healthcare sector costs.
  13: Adaptation to climate change is as important as mitigation for Russian economic
    development due to climate change in the Arctic. A comprehensive framework of
    Russian Arctic policy measures centered around climate change is yet to be developed.
    International cooperation is a key factor in accumulating knowledge.
  17: The page highlights the economic consequences of climate change in the Russian
    Arctic, including impacts on infrastructure due to permafrost thaw and risks to
    public health.
Methodology:
  3: Analysis of domestic policy documents, existing literature, and implemented and
    planned infrastructure and energy projects in the Russian Arctic.
  8: No relevant information
  13: Modelling assessment of the economic impacts of climate change is suggested.
  17: The document includes assessments and evaluations of climate change impacts,
    including economic evaluations of damage from natural disasters and permafrost
    degradation. Some assessments are based on climate models.
More Notes:
  2: The literature on climate change impacts on Russian Arctic development is scant
    and sometimes contradictory.
  6: The paper argues that benefits Russia may derive from climate change impacts
    will likely be more than compensated by losses from permafrost melting.
  7: The map indicates the regions of Russia exposed to the risk of permafrost thaw.
  8: This page focuses on studies that estimate costs associated with permafrost thaw
    and infrastructure damage in Russia, but it does not directly present any analysis
    or estimates derived by the authors of the paper itself.
  9: Significant uncertainties in future climate change projections due to insufficient
    data and monitoring facilities in the Arctic.
  13: The current suspension of collaboration between Russia and other Arctic states
    within key Arctic institutions serves as a severe barrier for further bridging
    the knowledge gap necessary to support climate change adaptation.
  17: A significant portion of the listed research focuses on the Russian Arctic and
    is written in Russian. The listed documents from the President of the Russian
    Federation outline strategic priorities and policies related to the Arctic region
    and energy security. Many of the listed documents were accessed on November 11,
    2022, suggesting a focus on contemporary analysis.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: GDP effects for northern regions of Russia, contribution to Russia's total exports
  3: Discussion focuses on the balance between climate-related opportunities and risks
    in the Russian Arctic, without specific quantitative outcomes.
  4: Economic development of the Arctic region, impact on shipping distances and times,
    potential for fuel savings
  6: Climate change-induced damage for Russian economy.
  7: Potential systemic macroeconomic risk to the Russian economy due to permafrost
    thawing.
  8: No relevant information
  9: Permafrost thaw may lead to healthcare costs equaling 3% of the total annual
    healthcare budget.

Quantitative material:
  2: "Northern regions of Russia make up about 10% of national GDP and contribute\
    \ around 20% to the Russia\u2019s total exports; Arctic accounts for the production\
    \ of 18% of oil and 90% of natural and associated gas in Russia; About 90% of\
    \ nickel and cobalt, 60% of copper, and almost 100% of diamonds and rare earth\
    \ metals are extracted there; around 2.5 million people in Russia live above the\
    \ Arctic Circle, which accounts for about a half of the total population of the\
    \ Arctic in the world."
  4: "Temperature increase in the Russian Arctic has been 0.8\u20131.2 \xB0C per decade\
    \ in 1976\u20132020. September Arctic ice cover has been decreasing at a rate\
    \ of 13% per decade since the 1980s. Yearly minimum Arctic Sea ice extent decreased\
    \ by \u221212.8 \xB1 2.3% per decade in 1979\u20132019, and the yearly maximum\
    \ sea ice extent decreased by \u22122.7 \xB1 0.5% per decade in 1979\u20132019.\
    \ Distance from Porsgrunn (Norway) to Qingdao (China) is about 40% shorter through\
    \ the Northern Sea Route than the Suez Canal and Malacca Strait. Mean transport\
    \ distance from Northern Europe to Asia and North America can be shortened up\
    \ to 50% compared to southern routes by the end of the twenty-first century."
  7: "By the end of the century, the reduction will account for 40 \xB1 15% and 72\
    \ \xB1 20% correspondingly (Roshydromet 2021)."
  8: No relevant information
  9: Decrease in winter road operability by 4% from 1970 to 2000; Overland travel
