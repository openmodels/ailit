Drivers of Risk:
  1: "Different global scenarios based on demographic and economic projections developed\
    \ in the context of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s Shared\
    \ Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)."
  2: Changes in income distribution, average GDP per capita, population by age and
    educational attainment level, economic growth scenarios (SSPs).
  3: Different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) with varying assumptions about
    economic growth, education, population growth, income inequality, and fossil fuel
    demand.
  4: Different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and their associated economic
    growth projections; Lack of further development policy efforts
  5: Climate change (implied through the use of SSP scenarios), demographic trends,
    education policy, trade policy, total factor productivity growth, capital intensity,
    human capital dynamics.
  6: Different SSP scenarios (SSP1, SSP2, SSP3, SSP4, SSP5) representing different
    development pathways related to climate change and socioeconomic factors.
  7: SSP2 (benchmark) and SSP3 (pessimistic) scenarios are used to model poverty.
  8: Future realization of average income per capita trends and changes in country-specific
    income distributions are identified as uncertainties.
Highlights:
  1: Differences in poverty headcount and poverty rates across scenarios are largest
    for Sub-Saharan Africa, where the most optimistic scenario implies over 300 million
    individuals living in extreme poverty in 2030. The results suggest that fulfilling
    the first SDG will be difficult without further development policy efforts.
  2: The paper provides country-specific measurements of SDG fulfillment based on
    observed and potential progress in poverty reduction through the year 2030 under
    different scenarios (SSPs).
  3: "Changes in global poverty for the period 2023\u20132030 differ strongly across\
    \ scenarios based on the different SSPs. The benchmark projections of poverty\
    \ by country imply a high speed of poverty reduction in South Asia, East Asia\
    \ and the Paci\uFB01c. Largest differences in poverty \uFB01gures across scenarios\
    \ tend to be concentrated in Sub-Saharan African countries."
  4: Fulfilling the first SDG goal (poverty eradication) will be difficult without
    further development policy efforts. The African continent faces the most significant
    challenges in poverty reduction across different SSP scenarios.
  5: Education and trade policies can contribute to poverty reduction. SSP scenarios
    imply different policy environments for education investment. SSP1, SSP2, and
    SSP5 scenarios imply tendencies towards a more equal distribution of average income
    per capita, while SSP3 and SSP4 result in increases in between-country inequality.
  6: Significant variation in projected poverty levels across continents and SSP scenarios
    in 2030. For example, in Africa, poverty headcounts range from 317.32 million
    (SSP5) to 429.77 million (SSP3).
  7: The paper finds that initial GDP per capita and GDP per capita growth are significant
    determinants of poverty rates.
  8: Poverty figures are believed to reflect the best available estimates of current
    levels of poverty and offer unique information on how poverty trends may unfold
    over the time frame of the SDGs.
Methodology:
  1: "An econometric tool that combines country-specific historical estimates of the\
    \ distribution of income, using Beta\u2013Lorenz curves, with projections of population\
    \ changes by age and education attainment level, as well as GDP projections, to\
    \ provide poverty projections up to 2030."
  2: The study develops a methodological framework for modeling and projecting poverty
    headcounts globally, using a combination of worldwide income distribution estimates,
    macroeconomic projections of population, and income per capita scenarios from
    climate change research. It involves establishing a baseline for poverty, 'now-casting'
    to the present, and projecting forward to 2030 using GDP projections from IMF
    and other models (ENV-Growth model).
  3: Modeling of global poverty projections under different SSP scenarios, classifying
    countries based on SDG attainment, and comparing poverty reduction speeds against
    a counterfactual target.
  4: Comparison of poverty scenarios based on different SSPs to assess progress towards
    poverty eradication by 2030.
  5: Combines IMF GDP forecasts with income projections from SSP scenarios, using
    models from Dellink et al. (2017) and Crespo-Cuaresma (2017). Reconstructs income
    distribution using World Bank PovCal database, Poverty and Equity Database, and
    UNU-WIDER's World Income Inequality Database.
  6: Estimation of poverty headcount ratios using country-specific Beta-Lorenz curves.
    Averages taken across 3-year periods to abstract from business cycle effects.
  7: The paper employs Beta-Lorenz curves calibrated to country-specific values to
    project poverty headcounts. It also uses regression-based poverty estimates for
    countries with missing income distribution data, based on a poverty convergence
    model. Logit and OLS regressions are performed.
  8: The projection exercise combines existing GDP projections for SSP scenarios into
    a single average income trend for each country, keeping within-country income
    distributions fixed at the present.
More Notes:
  1: The paper presents internally consistent poverty projections for all countries
    of the world.
  2: The analysis uses Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) to project poverty under
    different narratives about future global socioeconomic developments, considering
    challenges to mitigation and adaptation to climate change.
  3: The benchmark SSP2 scenario implies worldwide income convergence trends over
    the present century and thus represents a relatively optimistic view of future
    economic development, in particular in Sub-Saharan African countries. All projections
    presented assume no change in the within-country distribution of income.
  4: The poverty figures are presented as projections to understand potential poverty
    changes under different narratives rather than forecasts aimed at optimizing out-of-sample
    predictive accuracy. The economic growth projections emphasize the role played
    by human capital accumulation in the form of formal education.
  5: The study uses SSP-specific human capital projections to account for the impact
    of education on labor productivity and technological progress.
  6: The graphs show primary energy consumption and population from 2020 to 2100 under
    the different SSP scenarios, but these are not directly linked to the poverty
    analysis on this page.
  7: The paper acknowledges that different functional forms for estimating poverty
    may yield different results and uses the Beta-Lorenz curve to maintain consistency
    across countries. A global population density map is included.
  8: The estimates are based on survey data and may suffer from limitations, such
    as excluding populations like refugees, street children, or the homeless. There
    is also a lack of adjustment for cost of living differences between urban and
    rural areas, except for a handful of countries.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Poverty rates and poverty headcount (number of persons living in poverty).
  2: Poverty headcount (number of people living below $1.90 per day in 2011 PPP terms).
  3: Global poverty rates, number of people living in extreme poverty
  4: Poverty rates
  5: Poverty reduction, average income per capita.
  6: Poverty headcount and poverty rate, by continent and Shared Socioeconomic Pathway
    (SSP) scenario.
  7: Poverty rates are examined.
  8: Poverty headcount rates are analyzed.
Quantitative material:
  1: Worldwide poverty rates ranging from 4.5% (around 375 million persons) to almost
    6% (over 500 million persons) by 2030.
  2: Poverty headcount estimates for 188 countries and territories.
  3: In 2017, 647 million people live in extreme poverty; In 2016, 36 million people
    have escaped extreme poverty; by 2030, under SSP5, approximately 377 million persons
    living in extreme poverty; by 2030, under SSP3, more than 506 million persons
    living in extreme poverty; Under SSP3 Nigeria would have 15 million more in poverty
    and the poverty rate would be almost 4.5 percentage points larger than the benchmark.
  4: SSP4 projects a poverty rate of almost 26% for the African continent in 2030,
    compared to approximately 20% under SSP5. The SSP5 scenario only leads to three
    additional countries (Brazil, Burkina Faso, and Ecuador) achieving poverty eradication
    by 2030 compared to the SSP2 benchmark.
  5: Poverty projections for 2017 and 2030 under different SSP scenarios.
  6: Poverty headcount (in millions) and poverty rate (in parenthesis) for Africa,
    Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania, South America, and the World under each
    of the five SSP scenarios for the year 2030.
  7: "Table 3 shows regression outputs of poverty equations, including coefficients\
    \ for log of initial GDP per capita, oil dummy, log of initial GDP \xD7 Oil dummy,\
    \ GDP per capita growth, Log of initial poverty rate \xD7 GDP per capita growth,\
    \ and a constant term, with R-squared values."
  8: Countries with poverty headcount rates below 3 percent are classified as having
    achieved the SDG target.
