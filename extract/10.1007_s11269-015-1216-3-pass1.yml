Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change (affecting water runoffs), market liberalization (affecting electricity
    prices)
  2: Climate change (affecting water runoff), power market fluctuations (affecting
    electricity prices)
  7: Uncertainty of future prices linked to seasonality, interannual and intra-annual
    variability
  9: Climate change impacts on glacier melt and runoff, affecting hydropower production;
    Specifically, glacier melting initially increases runoff, but runoff decreases
    in the second half of the century as glaciers disappear; GHG emission scenarios
    A2, A1B, and RCP3PD influence temperature.
  11: Climate change affects mean annual hydropower revenue through changes in runoff
    from melting glaciers. Uncertainty in electricity prices, particularly interannual
    variability, is also a driver of risk for revenue.
  12: Climate change (GHG emission scenarios A1B, A2, RCP3PD), downscaling methods
    (DCM, EDDM, MRy, MRs, MRJD), and initial ice volume.
  13: The primary drivers of risk are uncertainty in long-term electricity prices
    and runoff, which are influenced by climate change and energy policy.
  14: GHG emissions influence electricity prices and revenue; Socio-economic variables
    related to GHG emissions drive medium-term uncertainty; Downscaling method impacts
    long-run mean runoff; Electricity price forecast uncertainty driven by model quality
    in the medium-term, unpredictable behavior in the long run; Future runoff and
    electricity price uncertainty influence revenue uncertainty.
  15: Uncertainty in runoff and electricity prices; climate policy; glacier melt model
    choice; GCM (General Circulation Model) uncertainty; water rights regulations;
    legal framework related to water rights
Highlights:
  1: Greenhouse gas scenarios may represent a low source of uncertainty compared to
    electricity prices. The main uncertainties are case study related and depend on
    the investigated variables. Runoff uncertainty shifts from variability (inherent
    randomness) to epistemic (limitation of science), while electricity price uncertainty
    experiences the reverse.
  2: Electricity prices present the greatest area of uncertainty affecting hydropower
    revenue and potentially jeopardizing future investments and energy transition/security.
  9: Glacier melting initially increases runoff, but runoff will subsequently decrease,
    leading to glacier disappearance by 2100; The reservoir can mitigate the effects
    of runoff seasonality; A new pumped-storage may be built from 2040, increasing
    energy production.
  11: Climate change affects mean annual hydropower revenue, but the variation between
    GHG emission scenarios is low, particularly in the period 2071-2100. The interannual
    variability of electricity prices can overtake all other uncertainties if annual
    price can evolve.
  12: Uncertainty resulting from the downscaling method has a greater impact on revenue
    than uncertainty related to initial ice volume. The choice of GCM-RCM significantly
    impacts the results, leading to a high degree of epistemic uncertainty if studies
    are based on few climate models.
  13: Price is the key factor for determining future revenue, but it is also the least
    predictable factor. Revenue is mainly correlated to price, and price uncertainty
    is a greater driver of revenue variability than GHG emission scenarios.
  14: Uncertainty about runoff evolves with time, transitioning from variability-driven
    to epistemic; Electricity price uncertainty transitions from epistemic to variability-driven;
    Revenue uncertainty is both epistemic and variability-driven.
  15: Price uncertainty is more critical than runoff uncertainty; Scenario analysis
    and mixed methods are valuable in short-term management; Decision-makers cannot
    avoid uncertainty
Methodology:
  1: Mixed method (quantitative models from natural sciences and economics combined
    with qualitative analysis of uncertainty). The quantitative approach applies various
    scenarios and datasets from different models. Uncertainty is analyzed through
    three dimensions of uncertainty.
  2: Quantifies the impact of climate change and power market fluctuations on hydropower
    revenue using a range of parameters, scenarios, and models (3 GHG emission scenarios,
    10 GCM-RCM combinations, 2 downscaling methods, 2 initial ice volumes, 3 electricity
    price models); Qualitative analysis of uncertainty following Walker et al. (2003).
  7: Uses mean-reverting models (MRy, MRs) and a mean-reverting jump diffusion model
    (MRJD) to model price fluctuations.
  9: Model validated using historical data comparing simulated hourly, weekly, and
    seasonal production with actual production and lake level patterns with real-life
    data; Case study based on the Mauvoisin hydropower plant in the Swiss Alps; Considers
    10 GCM-RCM with 10 paths for each.
  11: The analysis uses models to simulate electricity prices and hydropower revenue
    under different GHG emission scenarios (A1B, A2) and downscaling methods. The
    results are applicable to the Continental Central-South area of Europe and are
    intended to investigate uncertainty, not to forecast future revenue.
  12: The paper uses GCM-RCM models to simulate the impact of different climate scenarios,
    downscaling methods, and initial ice volume on annual revenue from hydroelectric
    power generation.
  13: The analysis compares various models and scenarios to assess uncertainty in
    long-term hydropower revenue projections. Uncertainty is classified as statistical,
    scenarios, and ignorance, and by its nature (epistemic or variability).
  14: Statistical methods (including calibration techniques) used to determine parameter
    levels; Panel of GCM-RCM used to limit uncertainty in runoff projections; Sensitivity
    analyses and use of different models recommended for dealing with electricity
    price uncertainty.
  15: Integrates runoff and electricity prices in a common framework to evaluate revenue;
    uncertainty analysis
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on uncertainty rather than forecasting. The originality lies
    in the combination of established quantitative models with qualitative analysis.
  2: The study assesses the uncertainties and their relationships related to climate
    change and power market fluctuations on hydropower revenue, highlighting the importance
    of considering these drivers together. Epistemic uncertainty related to the adaptation
    of the GCM-RCM model to local features also affects results.
  7: The models are designed for raw commodity investment analyses and assume prices
    are attracted by production costs.
  9: Operators are currently taking advantage of increased annual water volume due
    to glacier melting, a trend expected to persist for the next 20 years.
  11: The study investigates the impact of the downscaling method and initial ice
    volume on hydropower revenue. Trends from the various scenarios or models must
    be compared, rather than the numbers being reviewed in isolation.
  12: Electricity price models are conservative and do not consider drift. Annual
    revenue is not linearly related to annual runoff. The seasonality can explain
    results, even if the reservoir partially addresses this.
  13: The study emphasizes the high degree of uncertainty in long-term projections
    due to evolving market structures, human behavior, and technological dynamics,
    suggesting scenarios are more appropriate than specific predictions.
  14: Information about the nature of uncertainty (epistemic vs. variability) is valuable
    for decision-makers, as it indicates who should address the uncertainty (scientists
    or policymakers); Statistical uncertainty is tackled with risk management methods;
    Scenario level uncertainty is close to the knightian definition of uncertainty.
  15: Specific tools must be developed to tackle uncertainty, especially given hydropower's
    capital-intensive nature and long lifetime. The paper argues for managing variability
    through market design, risk-hedging tools, and energy policy, as well as increasing
    flexibility within the regulatory framework.
