Drivers of Risk:
  2: Physical risks, climate change.
  4: The data is used for assessing direct impact on tangible structures, which can
    be linked to climate-related risks.
  6: No relevant information
  8: Climate change impacts modeled via physical risk assessment requiring asset exposure
    data. Limitations and uncertainties in asset exposure disaggregation, especially
    in highly centralized economies, can affect the accuracy of risk assessments.
  10: Weather and climate events and other natural disasters.
  14: Asset exposure to physical climate risks is implicitly considered through the
    use of nightlight intensity and population density as proxies for economic activity
    and population distribution.
  16: Tropical cyclones, disasters (general)
Highlights:
  2: Presents a globally consistent methodology (LitPop) for asset exposure disaggregation
    and provides a resulting asset exposure dataset for 224 countries.
  6: "The Lit1Pop1 method shows the best overall median correlation (\u03C1) of 0.94\
    \ with the lowest interquartile range (IQR) of 0.09 when comparing different combinations\
    \ of nightlight and population data for the disaggregation of GDP."
  8: The LitPop methodology allows for globally consistent and spatially highly resolved
    estimates of gridded asset exposure value. The method's disaggregation skill can
    vary significantly by country, with Mexico serving as an example of limitations.
    Disaggregation skill assessment is limited to OECD countries.
  10: LitPop methodology provides a geographical distribution of physical asset exposure
    values that can be used to model first-order economic impacts of weather and climate
    events.
  14: The study compares different methods of disaggregating and spatially distributing
    asset exposure data using nightlight intensity and population as proxies. Lit1Pop1
    performs well, showing relatively high correlation and low error compared to other
    methods. The maps show spatial distribution of asset exposure in Mexico City and
    New York City based on different metrics.
  16: Nighttime light data can serve as a proxy for economic activity and human well-being.
Methodology:
  2: Spatial disaggregation of national total asset values to obtain a gridded asset
    exposure product using a 'lit population' approach that combines nightlight intensity
    and population data.
  3: A 'LitPop' downscaling methodology is used to disaggregate country-level data
    (total asset value and GDP) to a gridded level, using gridded nightlight and population
    data. The formula combines gridded nightlights and population data to compute
    a value per grid cell. This is then used to proportionally disaggregate total
    asset value and GDP to obtain gridded asset exposure and GDP data.
  4: GDP data is used both for scaling asset values to fill data gaps and for evaluating
    the LitPop methodology. A GDP-to-wealth ratio of 1.247 was applied to 59 of 87
    countries.
  6: "The LitPop methodology is used to compute gridded asset exposure data for 224\
    \ countries and areas worldwide. The Pearson correlation coefficient (\u03C1),\
    \ slope of the linear regression (\u03B2), and root-mean-squared fraction (RMSF)\
    \ are used to evaluate the disaggregation skill per country. The analysis is applicable\
    \ to distributing national GDP to subnational regions."
  8: "The paper discusses the LitPop (nightLights and Population) methodology for\
    \ creating globally consistent and spatially highly resolved estimates of gridded\
    \ asset exposure value. It evaluates disaggregation skill using metrics like \u03C1\
    , \u03B2, and RMSF. The approach disaggregates GDP at a subnational level, specifically\
    \ for physical risk assessments."
  10: The open-source LitPop methodology was developed to provide a geographical distribution
    of physical asset exposure values. It uses publicly available data sources to
    calculate gridded asset exposure data based on nightlight images, population data,
    and GDP. Can be used for global-scale physical risk modeling.
  14: "Asset exposure is disaggregated and spatially distributed proportionally to\
    \ nightlight intensity (Lit) and population count (Pop). Several combinations\
    \ are tested (Lit1Pop1, Lit1, Lit2, Lit3, Lit4, Lit5, Pop1, Pop2, Lit2Pop1, Lit3Pop1).\
    \ Skill metrics (\u03C1, \u03B2, RMSF) are used to evaluate the fit of the modeled\
    \ asset exposure data with reference national gross regional product (nGRP)."
  16: Uses nighttime satellite imagery as a proxy for economic activity, population,
    GDP, etc.; Also employs spatial downscaling techniques. Mentions exposure modelling
    for risk assessment.
More Notes:
  2: The LitPop methodology is available on GitHub as part of the open-source event-based
    probabilistic impact model CLIMADA.
  3: "The data quality depends on the availability of population data at subnational\
    \ levels. The nightlight data used is from the Black Marble 2016 annual composite\
    \ of the VIIRS day\u2013night band at 15 arcsec resolution. The total asset value\
    \ data comes from the World Bank's produced capital stock."
  4: GRP (subnational equivalent to GDP) is mentioned as a potential improvement for
    downscaling GDP.
  6: "The study uses reported GRP data for 507 regions in 14 countries to evaluate\
    \ the model\u2019s ability to distribute national GDP to subnational regions."
  8: The accuracy of subnational GDP disaggregation affects the reliability of asset
    exposure data and subsequent physical risk assessments. The Mexico example highlights
    challenges in accurately representing economic activity distribution in centralized
    economies. The methodology's skill is assessed based on metrics like global consistency,
    disaggregation skill, scalability and flexibility, openness, replicability and
    reproducibility, and low entry threshold.
  10: "The LitPop methodology does not account for differences in infrastructure types\
    \ and vulnerability. The use for local or sector-speci\uFB01c applications is\
    \ limited without the addition of sector-speci\uFB01c datasets. For risk assessments\
    \ with a local focus as well as in countries of low income, we would advise using\
    \ more local approaches and bottom-up methods for identifying and analyzing the\
    \ vulnerability component."
  14: The paper focuses on improving asset exposure data for physical risk assessment,
    which is a crucial input for macroeconomic and macro-fiscal risk assessments related
    to climate change. While this page doesn't directly provide quantitative information
    on macroeconomic outcomes or adaptation costs/benefits, it contributes to the
    foundation for such assessments by improving the accuracy of asset exposure estimates.
  16: Several papers focus on using nighttime light data to estimate economic parameters
    at various scales, including GDP. The papers on exposure modeling are relevant
    to assessing physical risks. Several IPCC reports on climate change impacts and
    adaptation are listed.

  8: "\u03C1=0.76 for Lit1Pop1 for Mexico. Reference nGRP for Distrito Federal (Mexico\
    \ City district) is 17.4% and the M\xE9xico district is 8.7%. The disaggregation\
    \ underestimates nGRP for Mexico City and overestimates for M\xE9xico."
