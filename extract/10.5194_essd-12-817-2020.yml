    reported Gross Regional Product (GRP).

    GDP to a subnational level, using GRP (Gross Regional Product) data from 14 countries.

  14: Asset exposure data for global physical risk assessment, specifically focusing
    on disaggregated asset exposure value.
Highlights:
  2: The asset exposure dataset is suitable for modeling physical risks.
  5: The paper aims to improve the estimation of spatial economic activity by combining
    nightlight intensity and population data, expecting to combine their skills while
    reducing limitations such as saturation and blooming in nightlight data and coarse
    resolution in population data.
  6: "Lit1Pop1 shows the best overall median of \u03C1 (0.94) with the lowest interquartile\
    \ range (IQR) of 0.09, where \u03C1 is the Pearson correlation coefficient."
  7: The general exposure value level in the metropolitan areas shown in Fig. 4 are
    largest for Lit1Pop1, highlighting a larger concentration of values in urban areas
    with this approach.
  8: The LitPop methodology performs well for most districts with relatively low GRP
    but fails to reproduce reference GRP for the main (capital) metropolitan region
    of Mexico.
  9: Lit1Pop1 methodology selected for asset exposure dataset due to its better performance
    in distributing GDP subnationally compared to other combinations.
  10: The LitPop methodology is open-source, replicable, and has a low entry threshold.
  11: The global consistency, flexibility, and openness of the asset exposure estimates,
    along with their integration in CLIMADA, offer value for economic disaster risk
    modeling and climate change adaptation studies.
  12: No relevant information
  13: The table presents quantitative comparisons between different asset exposure
    datasets for various countries, allowing assessment of their relative performance.
  14: Different methods of distributing asset exposure values (based on nightlight
    intensity, population count, or a combination) result in varying spatial distributions
    of exposure, as visualized in the maps for Mexico City and New York.
Methodology:
  2: The methodology is implemented in the open-source CLIMADA model and the code
    is available on GitHub.
  3: The LitPop downscaling methodology combines gridded nightlights and population
    data to compute gridded digital number LitmPopn. Total asset value per country
    is disaggregated proportionally to LitmPopn to obtain gridded asset exposure data.
    GDP is disaggregated in the same way and compared against reported GRP for evaluation.
  4: This paper describes the datasets and methodology used to create a global asset
    exposure dataset. It uses gridded nightlights and population data, along with
    GDP and wealth data from various sources, to disaggregate asset values to a fine
    spatial resolution.
  5: The LitPop methodology disaggregates total asset value per country proportionally
    to a function of nightlight luminosity and population count. The national GDP
    is disaggregated to a grid level, then re-aggregated for each subnational region
    to obtain a modeled GRP. The disaggregation skill is evaluated by comparing the
    modeled GRP with reported reference values.
  6: The LitPop methodology is applied to compute gridded asset exposure data for
    224 countries and areas worldwide, with exponents m=n=1. GRP data for 507 regions
    in 14 countries are used to evaluate the model's ability to disaggregate national
    GDP to subnational regions.
  7: National total asset values were disaggregated proportional to the distribution
    of Lit1Pop1 for 224 countries and areas. A total of 26 countries and areas without
    data are left blank, including Libya, South Sudan, and Syria.
  8: The LitPop methodology is used to disaggregate GDP to create gridded asset exposure
    estimates.
  9: The LitPop methodology combines nightlight intensity and population data to disaggregate
    asset exposure values at a subnational level.
  10: The methodology includes a scaling of exposure data proportional to current
    GDP for years without any data available.
  11: The study uses a methodology to estimate asset exposure data, integrating it
    into the CLIMADA repository. The methodology downscales asset exposure, but wasn't
    evaluated directly against subnational asset data, and the GDP evaluation was
    limited to 14 OECD countries.
  12: The paper uses GRP (Gross Regional Product) data for 507 regions in 14 countries
    to evaluate asset exposure.
  13: "The study compares different combinations of nighttime light and population\
    \ datasets to estimate asset exposure, assessing the linear correlation (\u03C1\
    ), scaling exponents (\u03B2), and root mean square factor (RMSF) between them.\
    \ All correlations reported are statistically significant (p < 0.05)."
  14: Asset exposure values are spatially distributed proportionally to nightlight
    intensity (Lit) and/or population count (Pop). The analysis is performed for Mexico
    City and New York, with maps showing disaggregated asset exposure value using
    different combinations of nightlight and population data.
More Notes:
  3: The study utilizes the Gridded Population of the World (GPW) dataset because
    it does not incorporate nightlight satellite data or other auxiliary data sources,
    allowing for independent enhancement of nightlight data. The produced capital
    stock from the World Bank is used as an indicator of exposure to natural disaster.
  4: The paper acknowledges that GDP is not a direct measure of physical asset values,
    but uses it as a proxy for scaling asset values and evaluating the LitPop methodology,
    assuming a correlation between GDP and wealth within a country.
  5: The selection of countries used for evaluation has a bias towards industrialized
    and newly industrialized OECD member states due to data availability constraints.
    The paper uses GDP and GRP as proxies for asset value because of the lack of reference
    asset value data at the subnational level.
  6: No relevant information
  7: The paper discusses the limitations of using nightlight intensity data (Lit)
    for disaggregation in urban areas due to saturation and blooming effects, and
    compares it with population data (Pop) and a combination of both (Lit1Pop1).
  8: The study evaluates the disaggregation skill of the LitPop methodology for 14
    OECD countries. The Mexico example is presented to illustrate limitations and
    uncertainties of the disaggregation approach.
  9: Caution is advised when applying asset exposure data for local assessments in
    low-income countries.
  10: For local or sector-specific applications, additional sector-specific datasets
    are needed, and bottom-up methods for identifying vulnerability are advised.
  11: The asset exposure data are not suitable for local or sector-specific applications
    without further validation. Future research could improve accuracy by integrating
    more highly resolved population data and ancillary data, and by validating against
    subnational asset value and empirical asset stock inventories. Regional validation
    could inform the choice of downscaling functionality for different income groups
    and regions.
  12: The table lists the countries, the number of administrative level 1 regions
    used, the World Bank income group, and the source of the GRP data with URLs. The
    URLs were accessed in January/February 2019.

  4: The dataset contains gridded asset exposure data for 224 countries.
  5: The paper mentions using exponents 'm' and 'n' to weight the relative contributions
    of nightlight intensity and population count in the disaggregation function and
    uses skill metrics based on the comparison of normalized modeled and reported
    reference values of GRP.
