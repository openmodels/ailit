Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change is identified as the primary driver of risk, leading to a slowdown
    and redistribution of global economic growth.
  2: "Temperature increases shifting away from the optimal average annual temperature\
    \ of 13\xB0C for productivity."
  3: Climate change, global warming, sea level rise, decreased innovation intensity,
    firms' reduced R&D expenditures, geopolitical events (wars, Brexit).
  4: Temperature effects of climate change
  5: The indirect global effects of climate change, such as wars and famines, are
    mentioned as potential drivers of significant reductions in sociotechnical complexity
    and deglobalization.
Highlights:
  1: The possibility of decades of relatively continuous economic growth waning due
    to climate change merits further attention. The paper aims to predict the processes
    that will affect the global distribution of information systems.
  2: Climate change is projected to significantly reduce global incomes and redistribute
    growth across nations, with many countries near the equator experiencing negative
    growth by 2099.
  3: Climate change is projected to significantly shift which countries are dominant
    in ICT goods and services exports by the end of the century. The US and China,
    currently dominant, are expected to be negatively affected in the long term by
    global warming, with potential ripple effects on other economies.
  4: Climate change is projected to cause negative growth in Vietnam, China, Malaysia
    and the Philippines by 2099, impacting their GDP per capita and potentially reducing
    the role of ICT goods in Southeast Asian economies. Northern and Eastern Europe
    are well-positioned to grow in future ICT goods exporting.
  5: The overall reduction in global growth is likely to have overarching effects
    on ICT, impacting the design of systems. Reduced economic growth can lead to reduced
    innovation in ICT systems.
Methodology:
  1: The paper engages in quantitative analyses to project the effects of climate-change-adjusted
    economic futures on information systems across different countries. It discusses
    frugal innovation and offers a theory of the retreat of innovations.
  2: Analysis based on the relationship between temperature and economic activity;
    Projections are made for GDP growth rates in 2020, 2060, and 2099; Analysis considers
    adaptation efforts similar to those to date.
  3: The paper integrated World Bank data on ICT exports with GDP projections from
    Burke et al. to project future ICT exports in 2099.  The calculations held constant
    the percentage of ICT exports, the ratio between GDP and total exports, and population.
    The projections are applicable under the specific assumptions outlined in the
    paper, acknowledging that the held constant values will in fact change.
  4: Projected GDP per capita and growth rates based on temperature effects of climate
    change; analysis of ICT goods exports and imports in relation to GDP per capita
  5: The paper uses design fiction and related topics to explore the implications
    of decreased and redistributed global growth.
More Notes:
  2: The analysis suggests that current adaptation efforts are insufficient to prevent
    substantial economic losses from climate change.
  3: The authors acknowledge that numerous factors not considered will influence the
    future, and that geopolitical events are impossible to predict. The ability of
    firms in negatively impacted countries to sustain R&D expenditures is also a factor.
    The analysis focuses on global trade in ICT goods and services.
  4: Analysis is based only on temperature effects of climate change, excluding factors
    like sea-level rise.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: The paper explores the impact of decreased and redistributed global economic
    growth due to climate change on future information systems and digital innovation.
  2: Average global incomes in 2100 will be 23% lower than they would have been without
    climate change.
  3: Decreased global growth, redistribution of global growth, effects on ICT goods
    and services exporting.
  4: GDP per capita, economic growth rate
  5: The page discusses potential reductions in global growth and GDP growth due to
    climate change.
Quantitative material:
  2: Average global incomes in 2100 will be 23% lower; By the end of the century,
    77% of countries will have their per capita income reduced; 104 of the 165 countries
    in the replication dataset are projected to experience negative annual growth
    by 2099; 19 countries are projected to be growing faster in 2099 than in 2017;
    113 countries are projected to be below +0.5% annual growth by 2099; 65 countries
    will be contracting at a rate of 1.5%/year or greater by 2099.
  3: Present ICT goods exports for China ($580B), the US ($150B), the Republic of
    Korea ($120B), Germany ($67B), and Mexico ($63B). Present ICT service exports
    for the US ($160B), the UK ($130B), Germany ($110B), France ($110B), and India
    ($100B). Projected ICT goods exports in 2099 for China ($4.4T), South Korea ($730B),
    Germany ($500B), the Netherlands ($350B), and the US ($340B). Projected ICT service
    exports in 2099 for the Russian Federation ($900B), the UK ($890B), Germany ($860B),
    China ($670B), and France ($590B). The US is projected to fall to 9th ($380B)
    and India to 14th ($260B) in ICT service exports by 2099.
  4: Vietnam's growth rate peaks at 6.3% in 2015 and turns negative in 2067. Malaysia
    peaks at 3.6% in 2025 and turns negative in 2059. The Philippines peaks at 5.0%
    in 2030 and turns negative in 2075. China's growth rate is 8.4% in 2011 and turns
    negative in 2096. By 2099, Vietnam is projected to fall to 162nd in GDP per capita
    rankings, China will gain to 90th, Malaysia will fall to 119th, and the Philippines
    will fall to 126th.
