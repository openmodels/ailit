Drivers of Risk:
  1: Global climate change
  4: production of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and other climate change forcings, such
    as aerosols and changes in albedo from many food system activities
  9: Mean growing season temperatures are likely to equal current extremes in temperate
    areas and exceed them in the tropics and subtropics, resulting in major impacts
    on food production. The observed climate change is faster than predicted. Particular
    climatic variables, such as temperature extremes, may play a greater role than
    previously anticipated.
  12: Extreme weather events (wet spells, hot spells), increasing temperatures, climate
    variability, longer-term climatic trends.
  13: Climate change impacts such as increased climate variability, extreme weather
    events, and long-term trends affecting food availability, food security, and agricultural
    yields.
  15: Climate change, land degradation, agriculture-driven emissions, deforestation,
    land-use change
  18: Shocks or changes impacting outcomes include direct productivity shocks and
    changes in trade terms.
  21: Climate change impacts on food availability, particularly agriculture; interactions
    between climate change and other global environmental, demographic, and economic
    changes
  30: Burning, Rice cultivation, Manure management, Enteric fermentation, Agricultural
    soils, Deforestation, Land degradation
Highlights:
  1: "The impacts of global climate change on food systems are expected to be widespread,\
    \ complex, geographically and temporally variable, and profoundly in\uFB02uenced\
    \ by socioeconomic conditions."
  4: The food system contributes 19-29% of total global anthropogenic GHG emissions.
    Agricultural production contributes 80-86% of this at the global level.
  9: "Temperate regions will experience increased waterlogging, and increases or reductions\
    \ in crop yields associated with anticipated mean temperature rises of 1\u2013\
    3 \u25E6C, whereas water-constrained tropical regions will undergo yield decreases."
  12: Postharvest losses on or near the farm are the highest proportion of food waste
    in eastern and southern Africa.
  13: Climate change is expected to slow, but not reverse, poverty reduction globally
    and disproportionately affect poorer populations, increasing inequality over time.
  15: Figure showing Regional Land-use and Land Change, emissions were estimated from
    direct and indirect sources.
  18: Broad-based economic development is more effective for food security adaptation
    than sector-specific interventions.
  21: The net effect of climate change on the global aggregate food system is anticipated
    to be significant if we do not adapt at a sufficient pace; adaptation and mitigation
    options to achieve food security must emphasize mechanisms to reduce the disproportionate
    costs that fall on poor producers and consumers in all countries.
Methodology:
  1: Historical statistical studies and integrated assessment models
  4: Data used for nonfood sectors is from Reference 23
  9: More recent work intimates that the projections of the IPCC up to 2050 may be
    overoptimistic for a variety of reasons.
  12: Recent data analysis for eastern and southern Africa.
  30: The analysis includes direct and indirect emissions from agriculture and forest-based
    land use.
More Notes:
  1: Low-income producers and consumers of food will be more vulnerable to climate
    change owing to their comparatively limited ability to invest in adaptive institutions
    and technologies under increasing climatic risks.
  4: In high-income countries, the postproduction stages of the food chain tend to
    have a greater role in emissions, while in other countries, specific economic
    subsectors are important, such as fertilizer manufacture in China.
  15: The map is a grayscale world map featuring the outlines of continents and countries.
  21: The paper acknowledges significant uncertainties in predicting adaptation needs
    due to the complexity of interacting factors. There is a focus on the food system
    and security, rather than direct macroeconomic aggregates.
  30: The regions examined are South and Southeast Asia, Latin America, China, Sub-Saharan
    Africa, United States & Canada, and Europe.

Outcome(s) of Interest:

    quality, and food safety
  4: No relevant information
  9: Yield losses are possible beyond 2050, leading to small impacts on global food
    availability due to compensatory institutional factors such as enhanced global
    markets. Major changes in food production are anticipated beyond 2050.
  12: Economic consequences to the industry and transmission of high prices to consumers
    due to wet spells during harvest in the Australian sugar cane industry.
  13: The paper discusses the potential impact of climate change on food security,
    which can indirectly affect GDP and economic productivity through reduced agricultural
    yields and income generation in climate-sensitive sectors such as agriculture.
  15: Additional malnourished children, agricultural emissions, deforestation
  18: The impacts of climate change on national household welfare depend on direct
    productivity shocks and changes to the relative terms of trade.

    food safety; disproportionate costs that fall on poor producers and consumers
  30: Regional equivalent emissions
Quantitative material:
  1: "Food systems contribute 19%\u201329% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas\
    \ (GHG) emissions, releasing 9,800\u201316,900 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent\
    \ (MtCO2e) in 2008. Agricultural production, including indirect emissions associated\
    \ with land-cover change, contributes 80%\u201386% of total food system emissions"
  4: "total global GHG emissions for the year 2008 in the range of 9,800 to 16,900\
    \ megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) from the food system, inclusive\
    \ of indirect emissions associated with land-cover change contributing 19%\u2013\
    29% of total global anthropogenic GHG emissions"
  12: Yield losses averaging 5%-35% for different cereals (maize being the highest)
    and an aggregate 15% of production value lost each year in eastern and southern
    Africa due to postharvest losses. Postharvest losses may be as high as 80% for
    rice in Vietnam and 50% for fresh vegetables in Indonesia. Multimillion-dollar
    losses caused by wet spells during harvest in the Australian sugar cane industry.
