1,Vegetative productivity,Africa,Desertification,1997,No CC,percent,-25,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5,Estimates from UNEP (1997) indicating land degradation
2,Agricultural Production,Sub-Saharan Africa,Pre-1961 Rainfall Mean,1985,Actual Series,% of gap,-32,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,14,This estimates the reduced gap in agricultural production between SSA and non-SSA countries if rainfall conditions were held at pre-1961 means. The year 1985 is chosen to represent the mid-1980s when rainfall was at its lowest.
3,Agricultural production gap,Sub-Saharan Africa,Pre-1960s climate,2000,Observed gap,Percentage,-68,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,15,The absence of the climate changes since the 1960s would have resulted in 32% of the observed gap in agricultural production between SSA and other developing countries by the end of the 20th century. The implied percentage is 100-32 = 68% reduced agricultural production gap due to climate change.
