Drivers of Risk:
  2: Identifies relevant hazards for each RKR and reports on their current state and
    expected future changes in magnitude, intensity, and/or frequency, linking these
    changes to Global Warming Levels (GWLs) to the extent possible.
  5: Extreme heat, coastal flooding, storms, shifts in insect habitat range due to
    warming, changes in precipitation patterns, droughts, increased precipitation
    variability, changes in average precipitation patterns, sea level rise, permafrost
    thaw, extreme cold.
  6: Changes in average precipitation patterns, extreme precipitation events (flooding),
    droughts, changes in snow cover and glacier mass loss, sea level rise.
  8: The analysis focuses on various climate impact drivers (CIDs)/hazards.
  9: Global average SSTs, warming scenarios
  11: Shocks impacting outcomes include inland floods from heavy precipitation, increased
    drought frequency and severity, enhanced fire weather conditions, and increased
    tropical cyclone precipitation intensity and wind speeds.
  12: Shocks or changes include global mean temperature rise and its effects on Arctic
    warming, sea level rise, permafrost, glacier mass, marine heatwaves, and drought
    events.
  13: "Global warming levels (GWLs) from 1.5\xB0C to 5\xB0C are key drivers for sea\
    \ ice loss, glacier mass loss, sea level rise, and changes in storm surge frequency."
  14: Storm surges are enhanced by the amount of relative sea level rise experienced
    at locations by 2100 if global temperature reaches specific global warming levels
    by that date. Extreme air pollution events are favored by meteorological conditions
    influenced by climate change. Higher frequencies of concurrent heatwaves and droughts,
    and of compound (sea level rise and storm-driven) flooding events are expected
    with additional warming.
  15: Regional warming and mean precipitation change, sea surface temperature warming,
    snow cover, permafrost thawing, heat extremes, tropical cyclone intensity, marine
    heatwaves, droughts and fire weather, storm surges (from winds and sea level rise),
    SLR and glacier mass loss.
  18: The drivers of risk include global warming, changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration,
    anthropogenic heating from buildings, and climate change impacts on surface ozone.
Evaluation overview:
  2: Focuses on the hazard components of Representative Key Risks (RKRs), not the
    full risks themselves (which include exposure and vulnerability).
  5: Living standards, human health (mortality and morbidity), food security, and
    water security.
  6: No relevant information
  8: The table summarizes the expected behavior of climate impact drivers (CIDs)/hazards
    relevant to eight Regional Key Risks (RKRs) as a function of global surface air
    temperature (GSAT) warming.
  9: 'Extreme heat: frequency and intensity'
  10: No relevant information
  11: No specific overview of an evaluated outcome like mortality or productivity
    loss is provided.
  12: The page provides an overview of the direct impacts of global temperature rise
    on various climatic and environmental metrics.
  13: No relevant information
  14: The paper focuses on the hazard component of risk, acknowledging that exposure,
    vulnerability, adaptation, and mitigation also contribute. It presents a catalog
    of climatic impact-drivers (CIDs) that can become hazards and contribute to the
    severity of representative key risks (RKRs).
  15: No relevant information
  18: The studies evaluate extreme sea levels, anthropogenic heating of the urban
    environment, drought, security implications of climate change, and surface ozone
    concentrations.
Highlights:
  2: Provides a systematic representation of the future evolution of hazard components
    of Representative Key Risks (RKRs).
  5: Climate change poses risks to living standards (economic impacts), human health
    (heat-related issues and vector-borne diseases), food security (breakdown of food
    systems), and water security (floods, droughts, and water quality deterioration).
  6: "Geographic features are more sensitive to individual models\u2019 characteristics\
    \ than to individual scenario trajectories."
  8: The table categorizes the relationship between GSAT warming and CID/hazards as
    quantitative (pink), qualitative (yellow), or no robust relation (blue).
  9: Frequency and intensity of heat extremes have increased since the 1950s; SSTs
    increases depend on the warming scenario, with specific values given for high
    and low warming scenarios
  11: Key outcomes include increased severity and frequency of droughts, enhanced
    fire-conducive conditions, and more intense tropical cyclone precipitation and
    wind speeds with GSAT warming.
  12: Important outcomes include projected declines in snow cover and permafrost volume,
    increases in intensity and frequency of heat and drought events, and anticipated
    impacts on sea level rise and marine ecosystems.
  13: "Even with strong mitigation (limiting warming to 1.5\xB0C), a large percentage\
    \ of coastal locations worldwide will see the historical 100-year flood event\
    \ becoming an annual event by 2100."
  14: The frequency of extreme coastal flooding events will increase at all locations,
    with specific temperature thresholds associated with 100-year events becoming
    annual events. There is a potential regional surface ozone penalty due to global
    warming in high pollution regions.
  15: Many hazards can be put in a direct, strong relationship with global temperature
    changes. However, large uncertainties remain in the magnitude and rate of change,
    and changes may be path-dependent or non-linear. The hazard component is only
    one determinant of climate risks, with exposure and vulnerability also important.
  18: Highlights include projections of climate model results in CMIP6, extreme sea
    levels at different global warming levels, the impact of anthropogenic heating
    in urban environments, and climate change penalty and benefit on surface ozone.
Methodology:
  2: Draws on current literature and assessments to represent the future evolution
    of hazard components of RKRs as systematically as possible.
  6: Uses Global Warming Levels (GWLs) defined by Global Surface Air Temperature (GSAT)
    warming relative to the 1850-1900 pre-industrial baseline, based on climate model
    outputs from CMIP6 experiments. Pattern scaling is used to represent the scaling
    of mean temperature and precipitation with GWLs.
  8: The analysis relates CID/hazard behavior to global surface air temperature (GSAT)
    warming.
  11: Analysis is based on CMIP6 models and scenarios averaging, applicable to future
    global warming levels scenarios.
  13: "The study assesses how changes in the return period of current 100-year flood\
    \ events are sensitive to warming of even just 1.5\xB0C by 2100."
  14: The storm surge analysis assumes that storm surges are enhanced by relative
    sea level rise experienced at locations by 2100, contingent on reaching certain
    global warming levels. Analysis distinguishes cases where a quantitative relation
    was drawn, where only a qualitative but robustly unidirectional relation was drawn,
    and cases where no such relation has been characterized, regarding climate change
    impacts.
  15: Presents how climate impact-drivers (CIDs)/hazards are expected to evolve as
    a function of global warming levels (GWLs). A global perspective based on GWLs
    rather than specific emissions scenarios.
  18: The methodologies include climate model intercomparison projects (CMIP6), analysis
    of the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), and investigation
    of feedback dynamics between urban microclimate and anthropogenic heating.
More Notes:
  2: This paper is part of a special issue where other papers treat each of eight
    RKRs holistically. This paper focuses specifically on the hazard components.
  6: GWLs circumvent uncertainties due to differences between climate model responses
    but transfer uncertainty to the time dimension; paper focuses on the relationship
    between hazards and GWLs, not when those levels will be reached.
  8: The table indicates that confidence levels are based on the IPCC AR6 WGI assessment.
  11: ENSO variability and extra-tropical storm assessments are discussed, with some
    expectations about changes in storm intensity and track.
  13: The page discusses the impacts of various GWLs on multiple climate indicators,
    including sea ice, glaciers, sea level, storm surges, marine heatwaves, and ocean
    acidification.
  15: The study acknowledges that individual impacts are determined by specific local
    conditions and that some changes are driven by dynamics (e.g., circulation patterns)
    rather than just thermodynamics (warming).
Quantitative material:
  2: Aims to link hazard changes to Global Warming Levels (GWLs), implying quantitative
    estimates are sought.
  6: Arctic warming projected at 2-2.4 times faster than Global Surface Air Temperature
    (GSAT) over the 21st century; more recent work indicates 4 times faster.
  8: A quantitative relation is specified for some hazards (highlighted in pink shading).
  9: "Global average SSTs will increase between 2 \xB0C and 4 \xB0C under High warming\
    \ (SSP5-8.5, reaching GWLS between 3.6 \xB0C and 6.9 \xB0C); but only between\
    \ 0.4 \xB0C and 1.5 \xB0C under Low warming (SSP1-2.6, reaching GWLs between 1.3\
    \ \xB0C and 2.8 \xB0C) for 2081-2100"
  11: Includes quantitative projections of increased drought event frequency and intensity
    with global warming levels, and probabilities of drought conditions at different
    temperature increases.
  12: Quantitative changes are provided, such as Arctic warming, permafrost volume
    loss, and changes in frequency of heat and precipitation events relative to different
    global warming levels.
  13: "By 2100, SLR will likely be between 0.15 and 0.30 m, but by 2100, SLR ranges\
    \ from 0.44 m (GWL of 1.5\xB0C) to 0.81 m (GWL of 5\xB0C), with substantially\
    \ higher SLR possible for 5\xB0C. Historical 100-year flood events may become\
    \ annual events in many coastal locations by 2100 even with limited warming. Marine\
    \ heatwaves could become 2-9 times more frequent under SSP1-2.6 (approximately\
    \ 2\xB0C GWL) and 3-15 times more frequent under SSP5-8.5 (approximately 5\xB0\
    C GWL) by the end of the century."
  14: Surface ozone levels could respond linearly to GSAT increases but with differing
    effects; in low pollution regions, decreases of 0.2 to 2 ppbv per degree of warming
    are expected, while in high pollution regions, increases of the same absolute
    magnitude are expected. The map displays global warming levels that make current
    100-yr coastal events into annual events.
  15: No relevant information
  18: The studies include projections from CMIP6 models, sea level changes at different
    global warming levels, and changes in surface ozone concentrations due to climate
    change.
