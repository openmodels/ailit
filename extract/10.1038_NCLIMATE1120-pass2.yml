Drivers of Risk:
  1: Milder winter temperatures and/or increased snow depth shorten the seasonal life
    of winter roads. Reduced sea ice and thawing ground affect human access to the
    region.
  2: Changes in air temperature, snow accumulation, and sea ice. Declining winter
    road potential.
  3: Reduced sea-ice concentration and thickness, milder air temperatures, and/or
    deeper snowfall due to climate change.
  4: Climate change impacts on accessibility of land and sea routes in the Arctic.
    Specifically, changes in surface air temperature, snow depth, and sea-ice properties
    (concentration, thickness).
Highlights:
  1: All eight Arctic states are projected to suffer steep declines in accessibility
    inland, driven by lost potential for winter road construction caused by milder
    winters and deeper snow accumulation.
  2: Arctic littoral states are projected to gain increased maritime access, while
    many inland areas will experience longer travel times due to reduced winter road
    access.
  3: Reduced sea ice leads to increased maritime access, while warmer temperatures
    reduce winter road potential, impacting travel times.
  4: Climate change is projected to improve maritime accessibility in the Arctic (Northern
    Sea Route and North Pole route), but decrease accessibility by land, especially
    winter roads, leading to increased costs and potential economic disruptions.
Methodology:
  1: "The Arctic Transport Accessibility Model (ATAM) integrates climate model projections\
    \ of air temperature, snow depth, and sea ice with static datasets on land cover,\
    \ topography, hydrography, built infrastructure, and locations of human settlements.\
    \ The analysis projects changes in access to oceans and landscapes northward of\
    \ 40\xB0N by mid-century (2045-2059)."
  2: ATAM simulations of travel time to nearest settlement (TTNS) are presented for
    baseline and mid-century (2045-2059) for the month of November. Baseline is 2000-2014.
  3: ATAM simulations project travel times. Analysis assumes unchanging human settlements
    and permanent transportation infrastructure between baseline (2000-2014) and mid-century
    (2045-2059).
  4: ATAM (Accessibility Transportation Analysis Model) simulations using climate
    inputs from Community Climate System Model 3.0 (CCSM3) under the A1B SRES scenario,
    averaged over two 15-year windows (2000-2014 and 2045-2059).
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on the impacts of climate change on maritime and inland transportation
    systems in the Arctic.
  2: The accessibility of land or sea area dictates the transportation modes eligible
    to be used there.
  3: Canada, Greenland, Russia, and the United States will experience sizable increases
    in maritime access to their offshore EEZs. Inland areas of Arctic states face
    declining possibilities for constructing inland winter road networks.
  4: The study acknowledges limitations due to modelling sea-ice processes, coarse
    spatial resolution of the climate model, and not addressing long-term phenomena
    like soil destabilization from thawing permafrost or changes in terrestrial surface
    water extent. The model assumes optimal vehicle availability.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: No relevant information
  2: Increased maritime access could lead to economic benefits, while reduced winter
    road access could lead to economic costs due to increased travel times and truncated
    cargo transport seasons.
  3: Changes in travel time to nearest settlement (TTNS) impact economic activity.
  4: Increased costs in remote communities due to reliance on air cargo services as
    winter roads become less reliable; Mining, energy, and timber industries facing
    shorter time windows for ground transport, potentially becoming uneconomic. Costly
    mitigations include building permanent roads or redirecting towards coastal port
    facilities.
Quantitative material:
  1: "Projects declines in winter road accessibility ranging from -11% to -82% relative\
    \ to baseline for Arctic states. Projects that the Tibbitt\u2013Contwoyto winter\
    \ road is projected to lose ~17% of its operating season between 2008 and 2020."
  2: The time required for November overland travel from Bathurst Inlet to Yellowknife
    increases from 3.8 days at baseline to 6.5 days by mid-century.
  3: "North Pole (NP) accessibility to Type A vessels projected to increase by +56%,\
    \ becoming 100% accessible with an average transit time of \u223C16 days by mid-century;\
    \ Northern Sea Route (NSR) projected to become 100% accessible with an average\
    \ transit time of \u223C11 days; Northwest Passage (NWP) projected to be 82% accessible;\
    \ Arctic Bridge (AB) route transit time of \u223C15 days."
  4: By mid-century (2045-2059), Northern Sea Route and North Pole route will be fully
    accessible to Type A vessels from July to September, whereas the Northwest Passage
    will not. Table 2 provides specific accessibility percentages for different routes
    at baseline (2000-2014) and mid-century (2045-2059).
