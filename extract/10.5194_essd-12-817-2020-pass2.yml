    a subnational level, using GRP (Gross Regional Product) data from 14 countries.

  13: "The paper evaluates different exponent combinations for asset exposure data,\
    \ focusing on correlation (\u03C1), a coefficient (\u03B2), and root-mean-square\
    \ fractional difference (RMSF)."
  14: The paper evaluates the fit between modeled and reference nGRP (national Gross
    Regional Product), an indicator of asset exposure, across different data and modeling
    approaches.
Highlights:
  2: The paper presents a global gridded asset exposure dataset, which is available
    online. The dataset is intended to provide a globally consistent asset exposure
    base for modeling physical risks.
  5: The study aims to combine the skills of nightlight intensity and population count
    data to improve the estimation of spatial economic activity, reducing limitations
    of each individual data source. The goal is to find the most adequate combinations
    of exponents m and n for subnational disaggregation.
  7: The general exposure value level in the metropolitan areas shown in Fig. 4 are
    largest for Lit1Pop1 (Fig. 4c), highlighting a larger concentration of values
    in urban areas with this approach.
  8: The LitPop methodology can be used as a basis for globally comparable economic
    risk assessments.
  9: The LitPop methodology generally performs well in disaggregating GDP to the subnational
    level, particularly the Lit1Pop1 combination. However, due to data limitations,
    the method's performance could not be evaluated for low-income countries (World
    Bank income group 1).
  10: The LitPop methodology aims to provide globally consistent asset exposure data
    for global-scale physical risk modeling.
  11: Global consistency, flexibility and openness, and integration in the CLIMADA
    repository offer value for economic disaster risk modeling and climate change
    adaptation studies.
  12: Lists data sources for Gross Regional Product (GRP) for 14 countries, which
    is likely used in their physical risk assessment.
  14: The study compares different data and modeling approaches (based on nightlight
    intensity and population) for estimating asset exposure. The maps visualize the
    spatial distribution of asset exposure in Mexico City and New York City, revealing
    areas with high exposure based on different data combinations. The table summarizes
    the performance of different modeling approaches in terms of their fit with reference
    nGRP.
Methodology:
  2: This paper presents a methodology called LitPop, which combines gridded nightlight
    intensity and gridded population data to disaggregate national total asset values
    and obtain a gridded asset exposure product. The methodology is applied globally
    for 224 countries and is available on GitHub as part of the CLIMADA model.
  3: 'Produced capital values are currently available for 140 countries and five time
    steps: 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2014 from the World Bank wealth accounting.'
  4: For countries with missing produced capital data, non-financial wealth is estimated
    from GDP and GDP-to-wealth ratios. An average GDP-to-wealth ratio is applied for
    countries with no produced capital or non-financial wealth data. Countries are
    excluded if data is unavailable.
  5: "The LitPop method disaggregates total asset value (or GDP) proportionally to\
    \ a function of nightlight luminosity and population count. The formula used is\
    \ LitnPopmpix=(NLpix+\u03B4)^n * Poppix^m, where NLpix is nightlight intensity,\
    \ Poppix is population count, and n and m are exponents. National GDP is disaggregated\
    \ to a grid level, then re-aggregated for subnational regions to obtain modeled\
    \ GRP, which is then compared to reported reference values."
  7: National total asset values were disaggregated proportional to the distribution
    of Lit1Pop1 for 224 countries and areas. A total of 26 countries and areas without
    data are left blank, including Libya, South Sudan, and Syria.
  8: "The LitPop methodology is used to disaggregate GDP and create gridded asset\
    \ exposure value estimates. The skill of this disaggregation is evaluated using\
    \ metrics such as \u03C1, \u03B2, and RMSF."
  9: A 'LitPop' methodology is used to disaggregate total asset values, using combinations
    of nightlight intensity (Lit) and population data (Pop). The performance of this
    methodology was evaluated indirectly using GDP and GRP flow variables due to a
    lack of subnational reference asset values. The best performing combination, Lit1Pop1,
    was selected as the basis for the disaggregated asset exposure dataset.
  10: The LitPop methodology can be adapted to include alternative data sources and
    versions of gridded nightlight, population, and total asset values. It's available
    as a module of CLIMADA on GitHub under the GNU GPL license.
  11: Asset exposure data are downscaled using GDP and population data; methodology
    not evaluated directly against subnational asset data, and GDP evaluation limited
    to 14 OECD countries.
  12: The table lists the countries, number of administrative level 1 regions, World
    Bank income group (2016), GRP data source and year of data used for evaluation.
    Data sources accessed in January/February 2019.
  14: "The study spatially distributes asset exposure values proportionally to nightlight\
    \ intensity (2016) and population count (2015) to create exposure maps. The fit\
    \ between modeled and reference data is assessed using correlation (\u03C1), bias\
    \ (\u03B2), and root mean squared fractional error (RMSF). The analysis is applicable\
    \ to assessing the spatial distribution of asset exposure and evaluating different\
    \ data and modeling approaches."
More Notes:
  5: The selection of countries is biased towards industrialized and newly industrialized
    OECD member states due to data availability. The evaluation is indirect, using
    GDP and GRP because of a lack of reference asset value data at the subnational
    level.
  7: The map displays gridded asset exposure values scaled to a resolution of 600
    arcsec, with an underlying resolution of 30 arcsec (~1km).
  8: The Mexico example illustrates limitations and uncertainties of the disaggregation
    approach, especially for highly centralized countries. The LitPop methodology
    performs well for districts with relatively low GRP but fails to reproduce reference
    nGRP for the main (capital) metropolitan region.
  9: Asset exposure data should be validated against local data before application
    for local risk assessments, especially in low-income countries. The quality and
    resolution of the underlying population dataset varies between countries, which
    can impact the results.
  10: The use of the asset exposure data for local applications should be treated
    with care. The use for local or sector-specific applications is limited without
    the addition of sector-specific datasets.
  11: Asset exposure data are not suitable for local or sector-specific applications
    without further validation; future work should focus on integrating higher resolution
    population data and other ancillary data sources.
  12: The table provides insight into the geographic scope and data sources used in
    the broader study for assessing asset exposure and physical risk.
  13: The abbreviations for countries are specified, like USA for the United States
    of America. The 10 exponent combinations are not defined on this page.
  14: The heatmaps represent disaggregated asset exposure value in current US dollars
    in 2014.
  17: This page is a bibliography excerpt, so it primarily lists references. The Eberenz
    et al. paper itself is the only primary source, and the rest are references it
