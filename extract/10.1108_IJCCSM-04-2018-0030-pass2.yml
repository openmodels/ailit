Drivers of Risk:
  1: Changes in climate impacting crop yields.
  2: Climate sensitivity, particularly seasonal temperature and access to irrigation
    facilities in Bangladesh.
  3: Climate change leading to increased frequency of natural disasters (floods, cyclones,
    storm surges) and changes in temperature and rainfall patterns.
  4: Climate change impacting agriculture.
  5: Changes in local climatic patterns observed over the past decades.
  6: Climate change impacts, including changes in planting dates, variety selection,
    and fertilizer use; price variations.
  9: Climate variables (wet and dry season temperatures, rainfall) impact net crop
    incomes.
  10: Temperature (wet and dry seasons), rainfall (wet and dry seasons), soil type
    (clay and sandy).
  12: Temperature increase, rainfall increase.
  13: Shocks or changes impacting outcomes include future changes in temperature and
    rainfall based on climate projections.
  14: Changes in seasonal temperature and rainfall, availability of extension services,
    farm size, access to irrigation, farming experience, clay soils.
Highlights:
  1: Climate change may have both beneficial and harmful effects on crop yields; the
    effects will be more in countries whose economy depends on agriculture.
  2: Net crop income in Bangladesh is sensitive to climate, with observed positive
    effects of temperature rise in areas with sufficient irrigation facilities.
  3: "This paper attempts to answer whether climate change affects net incomes from\
    \ crop farming sector in Bangladesh, and whether crop farming will be pro\uFB01\
    table under future climate change scenarios."
  4: "Assessment of long-term impacts of climate change on net incomes from crop farming\
    \ in Bangladesh; Analysis of the marginal impacts of climate change and the potential\
    \ future impacts of different climate scenarios on net crop incomes; Suggestion\
    \ of policy measures that may enhance the adaptive capacity of the country\u2019\
    s farming systems in response to climate change."
  6: Crop-specific models may overestimate or underestimate climate impacts due to
    the inability to account for behavioral responses such as input replacement, price
    variations, crop shifting, and multi-cropping.
  7: The main advantage of the Ricardian model is that it accounts for adaptation
    because farmers tend to adapt to the climate where they live to maximize outputs
    and farm incomes.
  9: Climate variables showed a nonlinear relationship with net crop incomes. Farmers
    are employing various adaptation strategies, including using new crop varieties,
    adjusting sowing dates, and crop diversification.
  10: Temperature and rainfall in both wet and dry seasons significantly affect net
    crop incomes. Farm size and access to irrigation have a statistically significant
    positive impact on net crop income. Clay soil is associated with lower net incomes.
  12: In Bangladesh, higher temperatures can lead to increased net crop incomes due
    to irrigation and more cropping seasons. Some colder regions may experience negative
    impacts from warming. Rainfall increases generally lead to increased net crop
    income.
  13: Future climate changes will lead to varied impacts on net crop incomes across
    different climatic zones, with potential income increases in agriculture due to
    adaptation.
  14: Farmers' current net incomes are sensitive to climate, with seasonal temperature
    having a more pronounced effect than seasonal rainfall. Net crop income is more
    elastic to changes in temperature than rainfall, with significant seasonal and
    spatial variations in impacts.
Methodology:
  1: A Ricardian model was used to estimate the relationship between net crop income
    and climate variables; regression model developed of net crop.
  2: Economic impacts of climate change on crop farming in Bangladesh measured using
    a Ricardian econometric model.
  3: No relevant information
  4: Ricardian regression models; Field surveys conducted between January 2017 and
    April 2017 considering the cropping seasons of 2015-16.
  5: Ricardian regression analysis using net crop income per hectare and climate data.
  6: Uses computable general equilibrium and whole farm models to assess climate-crop
    physiology and development; models include change of planting dates, variety selection
    and fertilizer use.
  7: The Ricardian model is used to measure the economic impacts of climate change
    in the agriculture sector by assessing the performance of farms across landscapes
    and capturing impacts of spatial variations in climate attributes and other factors.
    It relies on the observation that land rents capture the long-term productivity
    of the farm.
  9: Ricardian studies and models are used to assess the impact of climate variables
    on net crop income. Household characteristics are controlled for. Models explain
    3-16% of observed variations in net crop income.
  10: Ricardian regression models explaining net crop incomes across seven climatic
    zones in Bangladesh.
  12: Ricardian regression model. Marginal impacts of climate for each zone are calculated
    from the coefficients of the Ricardian regression model. Results applicable to
    Bangladesh.
  13: Analysis uses two Coupled Atmospheric Oceanic General Circulation Models (AOGCMs,
    specifically BNU-ESM and CanESM2) to estimate future climate impacts based on
    the RCP8.5 pathway, applicable for the periods 2021-2060 and 2061-2100.

More Notes:
  3: "The paper identifies a research gap in measuring the economic impacts of climate\
    \ change on overall crop farming in Bangladesh, and states that studies in this\
    \ direction are insuf\uFB01cient."
  4: Data were collected using a disproportionate stratified random sampling technique
    to have a representative sample across all 7 climatic zones in Bangladesh.
  6: The map of Bangladesh shows the surveyed districts, potentially indicating the
    geographical scope of the study or data collection.
  9: The study is specific to Bangladesh. The analysis suggests complex relationships
    between temperature, rainfall, and crop income, with both benefits and drawbacks
    depending on the timing of temperature changes within the growing seasons.
  12: The paper finds that Bangladesh's agriculture is adapting to warming. Groundwater
    irrigation and improved technologies are important factors in adaptation.
  14: The study focuses only on climate change impacts on net crop incomes and suggests
    future studies may consider analyzing climate change impacts on other agricultural
    sectors (fisheries and livestock).
