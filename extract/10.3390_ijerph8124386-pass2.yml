Drivers of Risk:
  4: Climate change impacts on the prevalence of cholera.
  5: Climate change (specifically rainfall and temperature) is linked to cholera cases.
  9: Climate change increasing the risk of cholera.
  10: Cases of cholera attributable to climate change
  11: Climate change (specifically, temperature increases and drought).
  13: "Climate change (specifically, 1\xB0C and 2\xB0C warming scenarios), Insufficient\
    \ preventative adaptation measures (water and sanitation infrastructure)."
  14: Climate variability, specifically temperature increase, is linked to increased
    incidence of cholera.
  15: Increased temperatures (1-2 degrees Celsius by 2030) leading to increased cholera
    incidence.
  16: Climate change impacts leading to an additional burden of disease, particularly
    diarrheal diseases.

Highlights:
  2: Climate change impacts on health sector (cholera) can result in costs of 0.32
    to 1.4% of GDP in Tanzania by 2030
  4: The article focuses on Tanzania and aims to estimate the total costs of cholera
    attributable to climate change, including costs of reactive adaptation, productivity
    losses, and lost lives.
  5: A seasonal pattern exists where lower minimum/maximum temperatures and lower
    total rainfall coincide with lower cases of cholera between June and October.
    2004 saw a large spike in cholera cases, peaking at over 2400 in May, relative
    to all other years from 1998-2004.
  9: Preventive adaptation measures are assumed to be implemented along with economic
    development in Tanzania, so the costs of prevention are not included in the total
    estimates of adaptation costs measures in this study.
  10: Cost estimates include treatment expenses, loss of productivity, and loss of
    lives attributable to climate-related cholera cases
  11: Temperature is positively correlated with cholera cases in Tanzania. A 1-degree
    Celsius increase in temperature could raise the relative risk of cholera cases
    by 15-29%; The GDP share of the costs is calculated based on GDP projections for
    annual GDP growth rates.
  13: The upper boundary estimate for the 1 degree Celsius scenario and the lower
    boundary estimate for the 2 degree Celsius scenario lie at around 0.6 percent
    of GDP.
  14: Climate change-induced cholera increases could cost Tanzania 0.03-0.12% of GDP
    by 2030 in reactive costs.
  15: Climate change-induced cholera is estimated to cost Tanzania between 0.03 and
    0.12 percent of GDP in treatment alone by 2030.
  16: Climate change will impose large additional economic burdens at both societal
    and household levels, highlighting the need for quantifying disease burdens at
    national and local levels.

Methodology:
  4: The analysis draws on primary data sources to estimate the relationship between
    climate variables and cholera in Tanzania and uses these results for projections
    of the future burden of cholera attributable to climate change in the country
    by 2030.
  5: Health Impact Assessment is used to analyze the magnitude of cholera burden attributable
    to climate change using climate change predictions, population growth, and economic
    development scenarios.
  9: Statistical models are used to estimate the relationship between cholera incidence
    and climate variables, controlling for socioeconomic factors. Different model
    specifications are tested and the preferred model is chosen based on significance
    of regressors and goodness-of-fit criteria (log-likelihood, Wald chi-squared,
    Akaike and Bayesian information criteria). A time trend variable is included to
    capture other socioeconomic factors.
  10: Reactive measures estimate additional costs by multiplying the number of cholera
    cases due to climate change by treatment costs; Loss of productivity calculated
    from daily wages multiplied by days out of work; Loss of lives valued using a
    GDP-adjusted Value of Statistical Life method
  11: Pair-wise correlation analysis of cholera cases with minimum and maximum temperatures
    and rainfall; Regression models using monthly and annual data to assess the relationship
    between cholera cases and temperature, rainfall, and drought; Cost-benefit analysis
    framework calculating total economic costs of cholera attributable to climate
    change.
  13: The study links cases of cholera to environmental and socio-economic factors
    in predicting climate change impacts and assessing the related costs. The study
    incorporates a future baseline disease burden, accounting for economic growth
    and health sector development.
  14: Econometric analyses were performed, but reliability may be limited by the length
    of available datasets. Cost estimates for reactive adaptation are based on unpublished
    data from the Tanzanian Ministry of Health.
  15: Cost calculations considering climate change projections.
  16: National-level scope for assessing impacts and costs, considering expected future
    economic development in Tanzania.

More Notes:
  2: The results provide useful insights into national-level estimates of the implications
    of climate change on the health sector and offer information which can feed into
    both national and international debates on financing and planning adaptation.
  4: The study uses historical data on deaths and cases of cholera, climate variables
    (rainfall and temperature), and socioeconomic data for Tanzania.
  5: The analysis is limited by the relatively short time span of the datasets (7
    years for regional data).
  9: All costs are calculated at constant 2006 US dollar rates.
  11: The costs of preventive measures are excluded from the calculations of total
    costs of cholera attributable to climate change, as they are assumed to be implemented
    in line with Tanzania's national development objectives.
  13: A large share of the costs (90 percent) is related to loss of lives. Productivity
    losses account for approximately 11 to 13 percent of the total cost of illness.
  14: "Preventive measures were not included in the cost estimates, assuming they\
    \ will be implemented alongside general socio-economic development and Tanzania\u2019\
    s national goals."
  15: The paper acknowledges limitations in its estimates, including the omission
    of autonomous adaptation and distributional impacts of adaptation measures.
  16: The study emphasizes the need for more and improved projections of future risks
    essential for national decision-making and refinements of adaptation costs.

    specific monthly wage estimates
  11: 'VOSL for Tanzania: USD 32,958; Risk ratio: A 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature
    would increase the relative risk for cholera cases in Tanzania by 29 percent (using
    monthly data) or 15 percent (using annual data).'
