  21: Net present value of future damages from one tonne of CO2 for damages occurring
    only within the CONUS.
Highlights:
  1: Net national damages increase overtime.
  4: FrEDI monetizes a broad range of climate-driven impacts in the US across various
    warming, emission, and socioeconomic trajectories in a short computational time
    frame.
  5: The analysis allows for the investigation of adaptation options, indicating adaptation
    has the capacity to both exacerbate and ameliorate future climate-driven damages.
  6: Climate-driven damages from FrEDI are largest for the health category, primarily
    from premature mortality attributable to climate-driven changes in temperature
    and air quality. By 2090 the damages are expected to be over 3.0% of US GDP.
  7: Infrastructure is also a major contributor to climate-driven damages.
  8: Temperature-related mortality is the largest impact sector in this study. Climate-driven
    damages vary geographically, with the Southeast experiencing the largest annual
    damages per capita and the Southwest the smallest.
  9: In each region, the largest monetary damages in 2090 are expected from premature
    mortality associated with changes in temperature. Overall, the negative impacts
    of climate change outweigh the positives such that net losses are projected in
    each region. Black or African Americans are more likely to be affected by additional
    premature mortality from climate-driven changes in air quality, while Hispanic
    or Latino Americans are more likely to experience lost labor hours.
  10: Climate-driven damages vary significantly across US regions. The Southeast faces
    the highest per capita damages, while the Southwest faces the lowest. The top
    sectors contributing to damages differ by region, indicating regionally specific
    vulnerabilities to climate change.
  11: Significant disparities in climate impacts are estimated, particularly showing
    higher mortality and labor hours lost for racial minorities and vulnerable groups
    in 2090.
  12: Premature mortality from temperature changes dominates monetized damages across
    all regions.
  13: FrEDI allows for investigation of adaptation options in select sectors. It is
    also capable of assessing the differential impacts in 2090 across different socially
    vulnerable groups.
  14: The most important outcomes are the estimated economic damages across a range
    of sectors, with temperature-related mortality showing the largest mean impact
    (USD 2300 billion) and a wide confidence interval.
  15: Most sectors show increasing climate-related impacts through 2100. Winter recreation
    shows a declining trend. Sharp increases in damages can occur after certain thresholds
    are breached (e.g., coastal property after 100cm sea level rise).
  16: Adaptation has the capacity to both exacerbate and ameliorate future climate-driven
    damages. Climate damages are sensitive to assumptions in the adaptation scenarios.
  20: The analysis highlights increasing trends in temperature-related mortality,
    air quality impacts, wildfire damage, coastal property damage, high tide flooding
    impacts, and inland flooding. Decreasing trends are noted for labor productivity,
    rail infrastructure, winter recreation, and marine fisheries. The total damages
    summed across all sectors are also shown.
  21: Figure A5 provides a comparison to the net present damages calculated using
    a constant discount rate of 3%, consistent with OMB Circular A-4. The plot shows
    net present value of future damages using constant discount rate (CDR) versus
    Ramsey discounting.
Methodology:
  1: Utilizes the reduced-complexity model, the Framework for Evaluating Damages and
    Impacts (FrEDI), to rapidly project impacts across 10000 future scenarios; projections
    extended through 2300.
  3: The analysis uses the FaIR model for climate projections and the FrEDI model
    for estimating economic and physical impacts using temperature binning and emissions
    scenarios.
  4: The FrEDI model is used to calculate sectoral climate impacts. It takes inputs
    from the FaIR climate model and RFF-SP socioeconomic projections. The analysis
    disaggregates national populations to FrEDI regions and uses regional damage functions
    derived from GCMs. It estimates sea level rise using a semi-empirical method based
    on global mean surface temperature.
  5: Analysis is performed using FrEDI, which projects climate damages out to 2300
    and calculates annual marginal climate-driven damages by comparing baseline and
    perturbed cases with a social rate of time preference of 3%.
  6: Uses the FrEDI model with 10000 baseline RFF-SP scenarios (emission, population,
    and GDP trajectories). Calculates net present value using both a constant discount
    rate and a Ramsey discounting approach. The analysis uses stochastic Ramsey discount
    factor to discount future climate-driven damages.
  7: The analysis uses the RFF-SP scenarios (emission, GDP, and population projections)
    and the FrEDI model to estimate climate-driven damages. The results are applicable
    from 2020 to 2100.
  8: The analysis uses the FrEDI framework and RFF-SP projections (10000 simulations)
    to estimate impacts in 2090. The sectors are considered independent and additive
    (with some caveats).
  9: Analysis uses 10000 RFF-SP scenarios and incorporates climate parameter uncertainty
    using a Monte Carlo approach with FaIR. Incorporates parametric uncertainty in
    damage functions.
  10: The analysis uses the FrEDI model to project climate damages. It also uses Shared
    Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) for emissions, US GDP, and US population trajectories
    from the SSP Public Database (v2.0) to estimate damages in 2090. The net present
    damages per tonne of GHG emissions are calculated by extending FrEDI projections
    to 2300 and using Ramsey discounting.
  11: Uses FrEDI damages estimation for socioeconomic input scenarios and assesses
    vulnerability through bar charts for air quality impacts and labor impacts across
    demographic groups.
  12: The analysis uses the FrEDI framework which is dynamic; however, it lacks explicit
    modeling options for adaptation in some sectors.
  13: FrEDI incorporates adaptation assumptions from underlying sector studies, reflecting
    historically practiced adaptation. It also models proactive and reactive adaptation
    scenarios for coastal flooding. It can be continually updated with new sectoral
    studies.
  14: The analysis estimates national annual damage statistics (mean and 95% confidence
    interval) for the year 2090.
  15: The analysis uses underlying temperature/sea level rise, binned damage functions,
    and sector-specific scalars to project damages. Slight discontinuities can occur
    either at the boundary between temperature bins or due to thresholds in the underlying
    studies (e.g., coastal property damage after sea levels breach 100cm).
  16: Analysis uses reactive and proactive adaptation scenarios, and explores sensitivity
    of future climate damages to changes in sectors like agriculture (with/without
    CO2 fertilization) and air quality, including high and low confidence intervals
    for damage functions.
  18: Damage estimates in FrEDI reflect year-specific socioeconomic conditions with
    methods for adjusting based on demographic changes or per capita damage rates.
  19: Extension strategies include scaling impacts with population or GDP per capita,
    using year-specific adjustment factors, applying population scenarios, and linear
    extrapolation of existing data past 2090.
  20: The analysis uses 10000 projections from 2100 to 2300 to estimate future climate
    impacts, calculating mean and median damages each year and displaying 95% confidence
    intervals.
  21: The Framework for Evaluating Damages and Impacts (FrEDI) is run through 2300
    to calculate the net present damages associated with an additional pulse of 1
    ton of CO2 in the year 2020.
More Notes:
  1: "Southeast is projected to experience the largest annual damages per capita (mean:\
    \ USD9300 per person annually; 95%CI: USD1800\u2013USD37000 per person annually),\
    \ whereas the smallest damages per capita are expected in the Southwest (mean:\
    \ USD6300 per person annually; 95% CI: USD840\u2013USD27000 per person annually)."
  4: The population projections used do not account for climate-induced migration,
    and the proportions for each region are held constant after 2090.
  7: The damages in each individual sector are driven by a large range of RFF-SP emissions,
    population, and GDP projections.
  8: The paper acknowledges potential double-counting between temperature-related
    mortality and air quality impacts. It also notes that compounding effects (e.g.,
    power outages exacerbating temperature-related mortality) are not fully accounted
    for. The analysis considers adaptation options in some sectors (e.g., coastal
    property) but not in temperature-related mortality.
  9: Confidence intervals account for uncertainty associated with the range of future
    emission and socioeconomic projections. Damage estimates are sensitive to uncertainties
    in the underlying damage functions themselves.
  13: The tool appears to bridge research gaps across multiple disciplines. The adaptation
    analysis considers reactive and proactive scenarios, noting the challenges in
    implementing even cost-effective adaptation measures. The temperature trajectories
    are derived from FaIR model runs of the 10000 RFF-SP emission scenarios.
