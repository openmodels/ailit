  15: Underlying temperature (or sea level rise); sector-specific scalars (e.g., per
    capita income-dependent VSL); thresholds in underlying studies (e.g., sea levels
    breaching 100cm for coastal property damage).

    precipitation patterns affecting southwest dust and valley fever, extreme weather
    events impacting infrastructure, shifts in electricity demand and supply, and
    altered conditions for agriculture, winter recreation, and marine fisheries.
  23: Climate change impacts, greenhouse gas emissions, temperature changes, sea-level
    rise, permafrost thaw.
Highlights:
  1: Net national damages increase over time; the majority of annual long-term damages
    are associated with climate change impacts to human health; damages vary geographically;
    Southeast is projected to experience the largest annual damages per capita; Black
    or African Americans are disproportionately affected by additional premature mortality
    from changes in air quality.
  2: FrEDI can provide policy-relevant information and complement the types of analyses
    and outputs provided by existing integrated assessment models.
  4: FrEDI is designed to monetize a broad range of climate-driven impacts in the
    US across various warming, emission, and socioeconomic trajectories with a significantly
    shorter computational time frame. FrEDI includes 20 impact sectors for which damages
    are modeled.
  5: Adaptation has the capacity to both exacerbate and ameliorate future climate-driven
    damages, with the latter being more common.
  6: Net national damages increase over time. Climate-driven damages from FrEDI are
    largest for the health category, primarily premature mortality.
  7: "National total damages in 2090 are primarily driven by the valuation of premature\
    \ mortality attributable to climate-driven changes in temperature, with a mean\
    \ of USD2.3 trillion per year. Total damages in FrEDI in 2090 is estimated to\
    \ be USD2.9 trillion (Mean, USD510\u2013USD12000 Billion 95%CI)."
  8: Climate-driven damages vary significantly by region, with the Southeast experiencing
    the largest per capita damages. Adaptation can significantly reduce damages, as
    shown in the coastal property sector. Temperature-related mortality is the largest
    impact sector, but it does not explicitly consider future adaptation.
  9: Largest monetary damages in 2090 are expected from premature mortality associated
    with changes in temperature. Negative impacts of climate change outweigh the positives,
    such that net losses are projected in each region.
  10: "Annual per capita climate-driven damages in the US vary significantly by region,\
    \ with the Southeast experiencing the highest damages and the Northern Plains\
    \ the lowest. Top sectors contributing to damages vary by region, highlighting\
    \ the heterogeneous impacts of climate change across the country. Annual damages\
    \ from all SSP scenarios fall within the 95% confidence interval (USD0.5\u2013\
    USD12.3 trillion)."
  11: Climate change is projected to significantly increase annual US damages, with
    substantial disparities in mortality and labor impacts across different racial
    and socioeconomic groups. Under SSP5-8.5, annual damages could reach 7000 billion
    2020 USD. Black or African Americans face the highest mortality rates and labor
    hours lost.
  12: Premature mortality from temperature changes is the largest sector contributing
    to monetized damages. The work emphasizes the benefits to the US from greenhouse
    gas mitigation.
  13: FrEDI allows for the incorporation of adaptation options in select sectors,
    particularly coastal property. Adaptation is also 'baked in' to econometrically
    based sectors to the extent it is already occurring.
  14: Temperature-related mortality has the largest estimated impact, with a mean
    damage of USD 2300 billion and a 95% confidence interval of USD 310-USD 9900 billion.
    Labor allocation (work hours lost) has a mean damage of USD 51 billion with a
    95% confidence interval of USD 6.7-USD 220 billion. The impact to Southwest dust
    is estimated at a mean damage of USD 18 billion.
  15: Climate-driven economic damages are projected to increase significantly over
    the century across various sectors.
  17: Proactive adaptation significantly reduces projected damages in sectors like
    rail and roads compared to no adaptation.
  18: Temperature-related premature mortality is a significant economic cost of climate
    change, with estimates varying widely across studies (e.g., Cromar et al. (2022)
    vs Hsiang et al. (2017)). Adaptation measures can significantly reduce these costs
    (Mills et al. (2014) with vs. without adaptation).
  19: The paper focuses on extending climate impact assessments to 2300 using population
    and GDP projections as scaling factors, combined with sector-specific adjustment
    factors.
  20: Significant increases are projected for temperature-related mortality, labor
    impacts, wildfire damages, and coastal property damage.
  23: Advancing estimation of future climate impacts, estimating the social cost of
    carbon, assessing temperature-related death and illness, modeling sea-level rise.
Methodology:
  1: Utilizes the reduced-complexity model, the Framework for Evaluating Damages and
    Impacts (FrEDI), to rapidly project economic and physical impacts of climate change
    across 10000 future scenarios for multiple impact sectors, regions, and populations
    within the contiguous United States (US); projections are extended through 2300
  2: The Framework for Evaluating Damages and Impacts (FrEDI) draws upon information
    from detailed sectoral impact studies to rapidly assess US economic and physical
    impacts of climate change. It uses warming scenarios and socioeconomic projections
    (GDP and population) to quantify impacts across 20 sectors. This study uses 10000
    paired probabilistic emissions and socioeconomic projections. Also, the method
    assesses the net present damage in the US resulting from an additional tonne of
    CO2, CH4, or N2O emissions.
  4: "Uses FaIR (simple climate model) to calculate global mean surface temperature\
    \ based on US emission trajectories. Global mean surface temperature, population,\
    \ and GDP are then passed to FrEDI to calculate sectoral climate impacts. FrEDI\
    \ uses bottom-up sectoral analyses and calculates damages as functions of CONUS\
    \ degrees of warming over time relative to a 1986\u20132005 average temperature\
    \ baseline. CONUS temperature change is estimated as 1.42 * global temperature\
    \ change. Sea level rise impacts are calculated using a semi-empirical approach.\
    \ Analysis is conducted at both national and regional levels."
  5: The study uses the FrEDI model to project climate damages out to 2300. It linearly
    extrapolates sector-specific, temperature-binned damage functions to account for
    the full range of temperature scenarios. It compares baseline and perturbed cases
    (with an added pulse of greenhouse gas emissions) and calculates the difference
    in damages. The marginal annual damages are discounted to the year of emissions
    and then aggregated across the time series into a single net present damage estimate.
    Differential climate-driven damages across different populations within the US
    are calculated at the census tract level as a function of current population demographic
    patterns. A constant value of 3% is used for the social rate of time preference
    as a discount rate.
  6: "Uses FrEDI model with RFF-SP scenarios, calculating net present value (NPV)\
    \ using both constant and Ramsey discounting approaches (Ramsey discounting with\
    \ \u03C1=0.2% and \u03B7=1.24, calibrated to a near-term target discount rate\
    \ of 2%). Considers 20 sectors. Damages shown in 2020 US dollars."
  7: Uses 10,000 RFF-SP (Resources for the Future - Socioeconomic Projections) emission,
    GDP, and population scenarios in FrEDI (Framework for Risk and Economic Assessment
    of Climate Change). The large distribution of damages in each individual sector
    is driven by a large range of RFF-SP emissions, population, and GDP projections
    and the dependence of the valuation approach for each sector on these parameters.
  8: The study uses the FrEDI (Framework for Risk and Economic Damage from Inherent
    Disasters) framework and RFF-SP (Resources for the Future - Statistical Protocol)
    projections to estimate future climate impacts. The sectors assessed are independent
    and additive. The analysis is applicable for projecting climate-driven damages
    at the national scale by 2090
  9: The analysis uses 10000 RFF-SP (Resources for the Future - Social Science Perspectives)
    scenarios. It incorporates climate parameter uncertainty using a Monte Carlo approach
    with the FaIR model. It also accounts for uncertainties in damage functions.
  10: "FrEDI (Framework for Risk and Economic Assessment of Climate and Disasters)\
    \ is used to project climate damages through 2300 and to quantify the net present\
    \ damages within the US resulting from an additional tonne of CO2, CH4, or N2O\
    \ emissions. The net present value is the discounted sum of a stream of future\
    \ damages produced by an emissions pulse in 2020 over the entire 2020\u20132300\
    \ time period. Ramsey discounting is used to estimate net present damages.  Comparison\
    \ with Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) is performed by using SSP trajectories\
    \ of emissions, US GDP, and US population from the SSP Public Database (v2.0)."
  11: The study uses the FrEDI (Framework for Risk and Uncertainty in Economics) model
    with different socioeconomic input scenarios (SSP1-1.9, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5).
  12: Uses the FrEDI (Framework for Risk and Uncertainty) framework to quantify climate
    change damages to the US economy, incorporating sectoral impacts and considering
    adaptation measures.
  13: Uses the FrEDI model, which incorporates emission projections, climate modeling,
    impact modeling, and economic analysis. Incorporates data from the EPA's Report
    of Climate Change and Social Vulnerability in the United States.
  14: The analysis appears to model the impact of various climate change-related factors
    on different sectors of the economy, and its results are applicable to the year
    2090.
  15: Damage functions are binned based on temperature (or sea level rise). Sector-specific
    scalars are applied (e.g., per capita income-dependent VSL). Analysis projects
    damages through 2100.
  17: Analysis is based on FrEDI model calibrated for future scenarios with adaptation
    options considered; estimates extend to the year 2300.
  18: The FrEDI model incorporates year-specific socioeconomic conditions and scales
    damages based on population and GDP trajectories. It uses adjustment factors derived
    from underlying studies to account for changes in health outcomes over time. Sea
    level rise damages are derived from studies that are year- and sea-level-rise-specific
    through 2100.
  19: The methodology involves scaling impacts with population and/or GDP per capita,
    and using year-specific adjustment factors developed from population scenarios.
    Some sectors' impacts are scaled with GDP or GDP per capita. The study uses distinct
    methodologies for different sectors.
  20: The analysis uses climate projections to estimate damages across various sectors,
    displayed as time series with uncertainty ranges. Applicable until 2300 in the
    figure A4 described in the first paragraph.
  23: Integrated assessment modeling, socioeconomic projections, temperature binning
    approach, simple climate models (FAIR, BRICK, Hector).
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on the contiguous United States.
  2: The analysis extends to the year 2300 for assessing the net present damage in
    the US from marginal greenhouse gas emissions.
  4: Population projections used do not consider climate-induced migration. The analysis
    relies on the RFF-SP socioeconomic projections. The results include confidence
    intervals.
  5: FrEDI considers reactive, reasonably anticipated adaptation, and no additional
    adaptation scenarios for different sectors. The analysis considers differential
    vulnerability across populations based on income, ethnicity, race, educational
    attainment, and age. The model incorporates historical or current levels of adaptive
    mitigation.
  6: Damage estimates include uncertainty in GDP, population, and climate parameters,
    but not sectoral parametric or structural uncertainty. GDP is adjusted to reflect
    climate damages. Much of the damage estimates are a result of mortality, which
    is not directly reflected in historical GDP estimates.
  7: The damages are sensitive to assumptions in the adaptation scenarios. The analysis
    includes a subset of potential climate impacts to the US.
  8: The study acknowledges potential double counting between temperature-related
    mortality and air quality impacts and compounding effects that the FrEDI analytical
    approach does not account for. Results are sensitive to adaptation options, as
    illustrated in Table A3.
  9: FrEDI (Framework for Risk and Economic Assessment of Disasters) is used as a
    source, incorporating parametric uncertainty in each damage function.
  10: The analysis focuses on direct CONUS (Continental US) impacts. Uncertainty is
    considered in the estimation of damages, including structural uncertainty when
    multiple damage functions are available for a single sector. The analysis calculates
    a 'domestic social cost of carbon' as net present damages resulting from an additional
    tonne of CO2 emissions.
  11: The damages estimated within FrEDI are constrained to the 48 contiguous United
    States and may not reflect global impacts of greenhouse gas emissions. Multi-century
    projections are inherently challenging, especially for socioeconomic projections.
    The vulnerability to climate-driven changes in air quality differ depending on
    race and vulnerable groups.
  12: The framework omits several non-market sectors and tipping elements, suggesting
    the damage estimates are potentially lower-bound. The study acknowledges that
    impacts from GHG emissions are global in nature and the US may experience indirect
    effects through trade, business, and migration.
  13: FrEDI allows for different adaptation scenarios (no adaptation, reactive adaptation,
    proactive adaptation) regarding coastal flooding. It acknowledges the challenges
    in implementing proactive adaptation measures due to short-term costs and uncertain
    future benefits.
  14: The table includes information on whether adaptation measures are included in
    the analysis (e.g., 'No additional adaptation', 'Reactive adaptation', 'Proactive
    adaptation'). The impact types are described in detail for each sector.
  15: Discontinuities in some sectors can occur at the boundary between temperature
    bins or due to thresholds in the underlying studies.
  18: The analysis considers how the sensitivity to socioeconomic drivers continues
    beyond 2090 through 2300 on a sector-specific basis.
  19: The paper describes how FrEDI sectoral results are projected, but it doesn't
    directly quantify the macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes. The relevance hinges
    on how these sectoral impacts translate to national-level aggregates.
  20: The page primarily focuses on sector-specific damages, which would need further
    aggregation and translation to directly link to macroeconomic and macro-fiscal
    outcomes.
  23: The references suggest a focus on modeling climate impacts, socioeconomic projections,
    and the social cost of carbon, which are all relevant to macroeconomic and macro-fiscal
    risk assessments. The models like FAIR, BRICK and Hector may contain more information
    on specific sectors of the economy.
