Highlights:
  1: Rising temperatures could reduce U.S. economic growth by up to one-third over
    the next century.
  2: Rising summer temperatures have a pervasive negative effect across a wide cross-section
    of industries, beyond those traditionally deemed vulnerable to climate.
  3: Utilities are one of the few sectors benefiting from increased summer temperature;
    temperature has a pervasive macroeconomic effect on industries in the U.S.
  4: Projected increases in summer and fall temperatures could significantly reduce
    the growth rate of annual nominal GDP in the U.S.
  5: The paper assesses the cumulative effect of adverse winter weather and summer
    temperatures on the annual growth rate of output. Section 3 documents economic
    mechanisms driving the main results, including the effect of temperature on labor
    productivity, on the growth rate of output in the cross section of industries,
    and in the cross section of U.S. regions. Section 4 analyzes the long-term consequences
    of global warming for the aggregate U.S. economy.
  7: An increase in the average summer temperature negatively affects the growth rate
    of GSP; an increase in the average fall temperature positively affects growth,
    although to a lesser extent; temperature fluctuations may also affect the volatility
    of GDP growth.
  8: The study finds difficulty in identifying a statistically significant effect
    of temperature on economic growth in the U.S. using both time series and panel
    data, though some results from the panel analysis are statistically significant
    at the 10% or 5% level.
  10: Temperature increases can have no effect, a permanent impact on the level of
    output, or a permanent impact on both the level and growth rate of output.
  11: Lagged temperatures are generally statistically significant, except in winter.
    The signs of the effects for summer and fall do not change when considering lagged
    temperatures. Contemporaneous summer temperature has a significant negative effect
    on economic growth, while contemporaneous fall temperature has a significant positive
    effect.
  12: Summer temperature effect is robust, fall temperature effect is not; temperatures
    affect labor productivity and output growth in specific industry groups.
  13: Stability of temperature effects on GSP growth from season to season is analyzed.
  14: Summer and fall temperatures have significant effects on productivity growth.
    Specifically, higher summer temperatures reduce productivity growth, and lower
    fall temperatures reduce productivity growth. The effects of temperature on employment
    growth are not statistically significant.
  16: Rising summer temperatures may negatively impact retail and real estate sectors
    due to cognitive biases affecting consumer behavior and outdoor search activities,
    and sectors related to agriculture will see reduced demand for other goods.
  17: Agriculture, forestry, and fishing show significant negative GDP effects both
    pre- and post-1997.
  18: Several service and finance industries show a statistically significant negative
    impact from average summer temperature on output growth post-1997, particularly
    Insurance carriers and related activities. Arts, entertainment, and recreation
    shows a positive effect, although not always significant.
  19: An increase in average summer temperatures negatively affects major U.S. economic
    sectors such as retail, wholesale, real estate, and insurance, with quantifiable
    reductions in GDP growth for these sectors.
  20: Higher summer temperatures systematically affect a large section of industries,
    accounting for more than a third of national GDP; the South region's GSP is particularly
    sensitive to summer and fall temperatures.
  21: Summer temperatures have a significant impact on GSP growth, particularly in
    warmer states; nonlinearity in temperature impact is noted.
  22: The effect of temperature on GDP growth is not driven by less developed states.
  24: Summer temperature negatively impacts GSP growth, and this effect is present
    in both the South region and the entire U.S. The negative effect of summer temperature
    on GDP growth is primarily driven by the higher development states.
  25: Provides a quantification of the effects of summer and fall temperatures on
    GDP growth over a longer horizon, assuming no adaptation or mitigation.
  26: High emission scenarios can reduce economic growth by up to a third of the historical
    average of nominal U.S. GDP growth rate.
  27: Summer temperatures appear to have a negative and statistically significant
    impact on GSP in many robustness checks. The magnitude of this impact varies depending
    on the specific robustness check.
  28: The negative relationship between average summer temperature and GSP growth
    is very robust. The positive relationship between average fall temperature and
    growth is not supported in several robustness checks.
  29: Increase in average summer temperature has a strong negative effect on economic
    growth rates. This effect is generally robust to various definitions of seasons,
    aggregation methods, deseasonalization methods, and sources of temperature data.
    The economic effect of summer temperatures is mainly driven by the months of July
    and August.
  30: An increase in average summer temperature has a significant and robust negative
    effect on GSP growth.  There is also a positive, but weaker and less robust, effect
    of an increase in average fall temperature. The summer effect dominates.
  34: State GDP growth rates are autocorrelated. There are correlations between seasonal
    temperatures. Panel analysis suggests a relationship between seasonal temperatures
    and some unspecified variable, with a statistically significant negative impact
    of Summer and positive impact of Fall.
  35: Summer temperature has a statistically significant negative impact on contemporaneous
    productivity, with smaller, more mixed results in other seasons. Temperature also
    has statistically significant negative impact on gross state product. Pre-1997
    temperature has negative impact on Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate.
  38: Southern regions show some statistically significant negative impacts from Spring
    temperature changes in Table A12. Table A13 shows negative impact for Summer on
    their panel analysis.
  39: Summer temperature has a significant negative impact on the outcome in Table
    A14, while fall temperature has a significant positive impact. Fall temperature
    has a significant positive impact on productivity in Table A15.
  40: Notable temperature impacts include a significant negative effect on agriculture,
    forestry, and fishing; finance, insurance, and real estate sectors show negative
    impacts; utilities, transportation, and mining show positive impacts.
  41: Several sectors show statistically significant GDP effects, including food services
    & drinking places (negative) and insurance carriers & related activities (negative).
  44: Temperature has a statistically significant negative impact on Gross State Product,
    Services, Retail, and Wholesale. Agriculture, forestry, and fishing are highly
    sensitive to temperature.
  45: Temperature has a statistically significant negative effect on several service
    sectors (Professional and business services, Other services except government,
    Food services and drinking places, and Insurance carriers). The Real estate sector
    is significantly negatively affected by temperature.
  48: Summer temperature has a statistically significant impact on productivity. Also,
    Wald test's p-values indicate the significance level of the coefficients.
  51: Real estate, insurance carriers and related activities exhibit statistically
    significant negative coefficients. Arts, entertainment, and recreation exhibit
    statistically significant positive coefficients. South region exhibits statistically
    significant negative coefficient in summer and positive coefficient in fall.
  52: The results are robust across various methodological changes and data sets,
    confirming the consistency of findings.
  55: No relevant information
  56: Temperature impacts human capital; temperature influences how time is allocated;
    these factors have implications for climate change.
Methodology:
  1: Panel analysis of the United States. Estimates combined with projected increases
    in seasonal temperatures.
  2: Analysis performed using a panel regression framework with the growth rate of
    state GDP (GSP) and average seasonal temperatures of each U.S. state.
  3: Analysis performed on post-1997 sample; industry-level effects of summer temperature
    on GDP growth are estimated with clustered standard errors at the year level.
  4: Combines estimates of the effects of seasonal temperatures on the growth rate
    of U.S. output with projections of the expected U.S. temperature change over the
    next century, under a 'business as usual' benchmark with no additional mitigation.
  5: "Regression analysis using daily station-level weather data from NOAA, deseasonalization\
    \ of weather data, aggregation of daily weather observations to quarterly averages,\
    \ analysis of average seasonal temperatures. Focus on the 1957\u20132012 sample."
  6: The study aggregates weather data from the station level to the county and state
    level using ArcGIS. County weather is calculated as a weighted average of stations
    within a 500km radius, with closer stations receiving higher weights. State-level
    aggregation uses county area or population weights. The analysis also uses non-deseasonalized
    gridded temperature data from the NOAA U.S. Climate Divisions' nClimDiv data set.
    Economic data including nominal GSP, national GDP, nominal GSP per capita, real
    GSP, and industry output are obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Bureau
    of Economic Analysis (BEA). State-level employment data are collected from the
    Bureau of Labor and Statistics.
  7: Panel regressions using weather and economic data from all 50 US states plus
    the District of Columbia; time-series regressions with country-level data; inclusion
    of lagged dependent variable and average seasonal temperatures
  8: Time series regressions using national-level GDP data and panel regressions using
    state-level GSP data, with state and year fixed effects in the panel regressions.
    The sample period is 1957-2012.
  10: "Simple illustrative example where aggregate output follows a linear process\
    \ depending on current and lagged temperatures. Considers three cases: No Effect\
    \ (\u03B2 = \u03B2lag = 0), Level Effect (\u03B2 + \u03B2lag = 0), and Growth\
    \ Effect (\u03B2 + \u03B2lag \u2260 0). The example is illustrative."
  11: The authors estimate a regression model (equation 8) where GSP growth is a function
    of contemporaneous and lagged seasonal temperatures, lagged GSP growth, state
    fixed effects, and year fixed effects. The sample period is 1957-2012. Regressions
    are weighted by constant GSP shares. Standard errors are clustered by year, state,
    and both dimensions. Wald tests are performed to assess the significance of the
    sum of contemporaneous and lagged coefficients.
  12: Panel regression with exploration of stability over time by shrinking sample
    size and starting the sample in 1990; robustness checks have been performed.
  13: Panel regressions are used with a focus on U.S. states weighted by their GSP,
    including state and year fixed effects. The analysis examines average seasonal
    temperatures on GSP growth with results applicable for the period ending in 2012.
  14: Panel regressions using data from 50 US states and the District of Columbia
    from 1990-2011. Productivity is defined as output over employment in the private
    sector.  The regressions include lagged dependent variable, state, and year fixed
    effects, and are weighted by the proportion of state GSP relative to national
    GSP. Standard errors are clustered by year, state, and both dimensions.  Significance
    is indicated at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels. The dependent variable is either productivity
    growth or employment growth.
  16: Regression analysis (equation 10) of output growth of industry group j in state
    i at year t on summer temperature, lagged output growth, state fixed effects,
    and year fixed effects. Analysis is performed separately for pre- and post-1997
    subsamples due to changes in industry classification (SIC to NAICS).
  18: "Panel regressions of industry output growth using data from 50 US states and\
    \ DC. Includes lagged dependent variable, state and year fixed effects. States\
    \ are weighted by their industry output relative to the national total. Pre-1997\
    \ sample is 1963\u20131997, and post-1997 is 1997\u20132011. Standard errors are\
    \ clustered by year, by state, and by both dimensions. Significance levels are\
    \ reported."
  19: The analysis uses regression models to estimate the effect of average summer
    temperature on GSP growth, comparing pre-1997 and post-1997 samples with data
    clustered by year, state, and both dimensions. The results are specifically applicable
    to the post-1997 period.
  20: Panel regression analysis of state-level GSP growth rates on seasonal temperatures;
    regional analysis divides the U.S. into North, South, Midwest, and West regions.
  21: Panel regression analysis on state GSP growth rates based on seasonal temperature
    changes from 1957 to 2012; regions classified by U.S. Census Bureau divisions.
  22: Panel regressions of US states sorted by average summer temperature, weighted
    by relative GSP, including state and year fixed effects, and clustered standard
    errors at the year level. The number of states in the regressions is reported
    on the horizontal axis.
  24: Estimates equation (11) using panel data from 1957-2012, including state and
    year fixed effects, lagged GSP growth, and interaction between HDI (Human Development
    Index) and seasonal temperatures.
  25: Combines temperature projections from climate models with estimated regression
    coefficients to project the impact of temperature on GDP growth. The exercise
    assumes that impact coefficients estimated in the main analysis do not change
    over time and ignores uncertainty about the point estimates.
  26: Analysis performed using GCMs and impact coefficients for seasonal temperature
    changes affecting economic growth.
  27: Panel data analysis with various weighting schemes (time-varying GSP, state
    population, state area). Robustness checks include alternative GSP measures (per-capita
    GSP, real GSP, private industries only), alternative definitions of seasons (meteorological,
    core seasonal months), alternative temperature data (population-weighted temperature),
    and pre-1950 deseasonalization.
  28: Panel regression analysis with various robustness checks, including different
    weighting schemes for states, controlling for precipitation and temperature volatility,
    excluding AR(1) terms, and excluding Alaska and Hawaii. The sample period is primarily
    1957-2012, with some variations depending on the robustness check.
  29: Regression analysis using alternative measures of GSP and alternative definitions/data
    sources of temperature to check the robustness of the results.
  30: Panel regressions at the state level, controlling for precipitation, temperature
    volatility, and lagged GSP growth. Spatial correlation is addressed using the
    correction proposed by Conley (1999) and adapted by Hsiang (2010), with a radius
    of 300 km.
  34: The paper uses panel analysis and autocorrelation to analyze the relationship
    between GDP growth rates and seasonal temperatures at the state level in the US.
    The results relating to the panel analysis are applicable at a grid level and
    are a robustness check for results shown in Table 1 of the main text.
  35: Regression analysis using gridded data.  Robustness checks of main results are
    presented here. The models use data pre-1997 and post-1997. See notes to Tables
    2, 3, and 4 in the main text for further details.
  36: Standard errors are clustered by year and by state, based on data from stations
    in Nashville and Las Vegas.
  38: "Panel regressions, using data clustered by year and state. Deseasonalization\
    \ of temperature data is performed by regressing temperature on monthly dummies\
    \ and a station fixed effect. Some regressions use constant GSP weights, calculated\
    \ as the proportion of state i\u2019s total GSP over the sample 1957-2012."
  39: Panel regression using state-level data from 1957-2012. States are weighted
    by their share of national GDP. Robustness checks include using temperature data
    aggregated by population.
  40: Analysis is based on temperature data aggregated by population with outcomes
    measured in sectors.
  41: The analysis uses temperature data aggregated by population to estimate GDP
    effects. Standard errors are clustered by year and state. The results are applicable
    post-1997.
  44: Regression analysis, with standard errors clustered by year and by state. Robustness
    check for growth versus level effects. Wald test for the hypothesis that the sum
    of coefficients for seasonal temperature lags equals zero.
  45: Regression analysis including contemporary temperature and a one-year lag of
    temperature. Standard errors are clustered by year and by state.
  48: Arellano-Bond estimation is used to assess the impact of seasonal temperatures
    on macroeconomic outcomes. Table A25 reports results using Arellano-Bond. Table
    A26 also reports robustness of table 3 (using Arellano-Bond).
  49: The analysis uses Arellano-Bond estimation for sector-specific regressions and
    considers seasonal regressions with different specifications.
  51: Arellano-Bond estimation is used, and the results are applicable post-1997.
  52: Includes robustness checks like using small sample adjustments and robust standard
    errors.
  55: No relevant information
  56: Analysis of temperature's impact on human capital in the short- and long-run;
    analysis of temperature and the allocation of time.
More Notes:
  1: Focuses on the effect of seasonal temperatures on the growth rate of U.S. output.
  2: The analysis suggests U.S. sensitivity to temperature increases despite adaptive
    technologies; distinct effects in Southern states; summer temperature impacts
    dominate those of fall.
  3: The analysis provides critical insight into how summer temperature impacts are
    distributed across different industries' GDP through a decomposition approach.
  4: The analysis focuses on quarterly temperature fluctuations and their impact on
    economic activities, disaggregating data into seasons and industries.
  5: 'Temperature is measured in degrees Fahrenheit. Seasons are defined as: winter
    (January through March), spring (April through June), summer (July through September),
    and fall (October through December).'
  7: The analysis focuses on the US states. The findings are relevant because temperature's
    volatility will contribute to GDP volatility, which has welfare consequences.
  8: The panel regressions weight each state by the proportion of its GSP relative
    to national GDP.
  14: The paper suggests that the main mechanism through which summer and fall temperatures
    affect GSP growth is productivity growth, rather than employment growth. Results
    based on US states, so external validity must be assessed carefully for other
    national contexts.
  16: The study acknowledges a data limitation due to the change in industry classifications
    in 1997 and attempts to address it by analyzing pre- and post-1997 samples separately.
    The results are primarily driven by 'Agriculture', the sector most exposed to
    high temperature.
  18: The analysis focuses on the US and the specific time period.  The coefficients
    are difficult to interpret without understanding the scale and units of the summer
    temperature variable.
  22: The increased effect of temperature on GDP growth in the post-1997 sample seems
    driven by a larger overall contribution of the South to the country's economic
    activity.
  24: Standard errors are clustered by year and by state.
  25: Focuses on summer and fall seasons due to a lack of statistical significance
    of coefficients for winter and spring.
  27: The table presents coefficients and standard errors, but lacks detail about
    the underlying model specification (e.g., control variables). Significance levels
    of coefficients are denoted as *, **, and *** without further context. The table
    only includes robustness checks and may not reflect the main results of the paper.
  28: The table reports robustness checks for a main regression. States are weighted
    by GSP relative to the whole country's GDP in the primary model. Standard errors
    are clustered by year, state, and both dimensions. Statistical significance is
    indicated by *, **, and ***.
  29: The effect of average fall temperature on real GSP growth is less robust and
    often insignificant.
  30: Results are robust to excluding lagged GSP growth (addressing Nickell bias)
    and excluding Alaska and Hawaii. Appendix A.6 contains further robustness checks.
  34: The exact variable analyzed in the panel analysis in Table A7 is not apparent
    on this page, so the relevance of that table is limited. The autocorrelation figures
    (AC(1)) represent the correlation of a state's GDP growth rate with its own GDP
    growth rate in the previous period.
  35: Significance levels are indicated by asterisks (*, **, ***), though the precise
    levels are not specified on this page and the standard errors are clustered in
    two ways.
  38: The exact meaning of the coefficients and the dependent variable(s) in the regressions
    is not clear from this page alone, as it refers to Tables 1 and 5 in the main
    text. Statistical significance levels are indicated by *, **, and ***. The analysis
    uses weather data up to 1950 for the pre-1950 deseasonalization robustness check.
  39: The tables A14 and A15 are robustness checks of Tables 2 and 3 in the main paper,
    respectively. Without the main paper, it is difficult to know what the main regressions
    are testing and what the dependent variable is.
  41: The table is presented as a robustness check of Table 4 in the main text.
  44: "The table reports the sum of the p-value of the Wald test for the hypothesis\
    \ that \u03B2s + \u03B2lag,s = 0 for each season s, where the sum is over all\
    \ the lags of seasonal temperature."
  45: The note at the end refers to Table 4 of the main text for additional information
    on the methodology and data. Two rows of results are given for each category with
    different specifications.
  48: The correlations between fall and summer temperatures are modest and indistinguishable
    from zero, suggesting multicollinearity is not significantly affecting the results.
    A one standard deviation increase in summer temperature results in a change in
    the growth of GDP between -0.2 and +0.2 standard deviations, depending on the
    specific industry.
  51: The notes refer the reader to Tables 4 and 5 in the main text for additional
    context. Results should be interpreted with caution due to changes associated
    with the introduction of NAICS codes.
  52: The data discontinuity in GDP by state series at 1997 is noted, cautioning against
    appending the series for 1963 to 2017.
  55: No relevant information
  56: The page references studies examining the relationship between temperature and
    economic outcomes like human capital and time allocation, suggesting an avenue
    for understanding climate change's economic consequences.

  14: A 1-degree Fahrenheit increase in average summer temperature negatively affects
    productivity growth, with a statistically significant coefficient ranging from
    -0.048 to -0.152 (depending on the standard error used). A decrease in the average
    fall temperature is detrimental to productivity growth (0.039 to 0.132). The effect
    sizes for winter and spring are insignificant.  The impact of temperature changes
    on employment growth is not statistically significant.
