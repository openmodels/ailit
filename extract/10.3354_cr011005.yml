  3: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  1: Sea-level rise due to anthropogenic global warming leading to land loss, increased
    flooding, and salinisation, with regional variations in impact.
  3: Sea-level rise interacting with other natural factors (e.g., sediment supply)
    and climate change factors (e.g., tropical cyclones). Human activities reducing
    sediment supply and sub-surface fluid withdrawals leading to subsidence.
  6: The page highlights the vulnerability of different regions to sea-level rise,
    which can impact coastal wetlands and lead to flooding.
  8: Sea-level rise, rapid population growth, local subsidence and sediment starvation
    in the Niger delta.
  9: Sea-level rise leading to land loss, population displacement, increased flood
    risk, and impacts on agricultural productivity; subsidence exacerbated by groundwater
    withdrawals.
Drivers_of_Risk:
  5: Sea-level rise leading to increased flooding, storm surge, and wetland loss.
Highlights:
  1: Regional cooperation can foster mitigation and adaptive solutions to climate
    change impacts, with benefits including sharing resources and articulating effective
    calls for mitigation.
  3: Small islands, deltaic settings, and coastal ecosystems appear particularly vulnerable
    to sea-level rise. Populated deltas, especially in South, South-East and East
    Asia, are highly vulnerable.
  5: Significant economic costs for flood protection and adaptation calculated; potential
    global loss of more than half of coastal wetlands with a 1 m sea-level rise.
  6: Optimal protection measures should be considered for harbours, cities, and areas
    with high tourism value or dense populations. It is less optimal in areas with
    low population density or lower income.
  8: West Africa appears to be vulnerable to accelerated sea-level rise, with significant
    land loss and potential displacement of millions of people, particularly in Nigeria;
    Rapid population growth will likely increase vulnerability substantially; Adaptation
    costs can be significant percentages of GNP.
  9: Bangladesh and Vietnam face significant risks with over 15 million and 17 million
    people potentially displaced respectively; potential decline in regional rice
    production by 4% without adaptation measures.
Methodology:
  3: The IPCC Common Methodology (CM) and similar approaches have been applied in
    national assessments. Vulnerability profiles are used to compare national studies.
    Analysis and synthesis are conducted for contrasting regions using local and national
    studies.
  5: Global vulnerability analysis at national scale aggregated to regional and global
    scales, with flood impacts and costs evaluated for 1990 and 2020 populations.
  6: Analysis involves exploring regional vulnerability using local and national assessments
    for specific regions like Europe, West Africa, South, South-East and East Asia,
    and Pacific Small Islands.
  8: Assessment of the impacts of a 1 m sea-level rise on Senegal, Benin, and Nigeria
    based on their 1990s socioeconomic situations.
More Notes:
  3: The paper acknowledges limitations in impact assessment due to incomplete knowledge,
    insufficient data, difficulty in developing scenarios, and lack of appropriate
    methodologies. Many studies only consider the direct effects of sea-level rise,
    potentially overstressing these effects and understating other changes such as
    population growth and migration. Studies often focus on a 1m sea level rise.
  8: The paper mentions that the protection costs for Benin are likely to be low estimates
    and the above figures are based on the 1990s socioeconomic situation. The costs
    and impacts would be significantly higher with the rapid population growth. The
    Niger delta is economically highly at risk mainly due to infrastructure related
    to the oil industry. In Nigeria, 600 000 people living in the Niger delta might
    require relocation as conventional protection with sea walls would be impossible
    without a very large investment and the application of new technology.
  9: The paper suggests that Hoozemans et al. (1993) may have underestimated the regional
    impact of sea-level rise on rice production.
More_Notes:
  5: Vulnerability classes for various impact categories such as people affected and
    protection costs are detailed. Emphasizes regional variability and effects on
    small islands and coastal wetlands.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  8: Capital value loss due to sea-level rise; Adaptation/protection costs related
    to sea-level rise.
  9: Potential loss of agricultural productivity specifically in rice production;
    food supply endangerment due to decreased rice yields affecting 75 million people.
Outcomes_of_Interest:
  5: Protection/adaptation costs estimated at 5.6% of 1990 global world income, equating
    to US $1000 billion.
Quantitative material:
  8: 'Senegal: > $500 million capital value loss, > $1000 million adaptation costs;
    Nigeria: $17000 million capital value loss, > $1400 million adaptation costs;
    Benin: $118 million capital value loss, > $400 million adaptation costs; Land
    loss (km2) and population affected (thousands) for Senegal, Nigeria and Benin
    under a 1m sea-level rise scenario.'
  9: Estimated land loss and population displacement figures for various countries
    under different sea-level rise scenarios; specific numbers for area and population
    affected.
Quantitative_material:
  5: Estimated up to 50 million people currently flooded annually, potentially rising
    to 60-120 million people with a 1 m sea-level rise.
