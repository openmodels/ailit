Drivers of Risk:
  1: Environmental factors affecting solar photovoltaic output
  3: Environmental factors such as solar irradiance, ambient air temperature, atmospheric
    conditions, terrain effects, extreme events, and long-term changes impact solar
    PV performance.
  4: Factors such as solar zenith angle, geographical location, cloud cover, and Earth's
    elliptical orbit contribute to variations in solar irradiance.
  5: Spectral distribution of solar irradiance, ambient air temperature
  6: Solar insolation and ambient air temperature are key environmental factors affecting
    solar PV output. High temperature leads to efficiency loss and faster degradation
    of solar modules. Irradiance has a stronger effect on current, while temperature
    predominantly affects voltage.
  7: Temperature elevation at the module surface routinely exceeds standard test conditions,
    leading to performance degradation.
  9: Atmospheric aerosols, dust deposition, and cloud cover impact solar PV efficiency
    and irradiance reaching the Earth's surface.
  10: High aerosol concentration regions such as the Sahara Desert, Middle East, and
    South Asia are indicated, which may impact climate and health.
  11: Dust accumulation on solar PV modules, humidity.
  12: Wind can increase PV efficiency by cooling modules, especially during peak sunlight
    hours, and reduces soiling by blowing away accumulation of dust and snow. Extreme
    winds can compromise structural security.
  14: Hailstorms, Hurricanes, Solar eclipses.
  15: Increasing humidity, frequency of wildfires and hailstorms, increasing temperatures,
    increasing cloud cover, and gradual shifts in atmospheric conditions altering
    global horizontal irradiance (GHI).
  16: "Solar irradiance, temperature, cloud cover, dust and pollutants, snow cover,\
    \ albedo, and extreme weather events influence PV performance. Aerosol load influences\
    \ the amount of solar irradiance reaching the Earth\u2019s surface."

  3: The expansion of solar PV across different climates is complicated by environmental
    factors that impact power production, necessitating a comprehensive understanding
    for performance optimization and energy planning.
  4: Monocrystalline silicon panels have the highest efficiency and power output;
    solar irradiance influences PV cell characteristics including efficiency and voltage.
  5: PV module performance is sensitive to both spectral distribution and ambient
    temperature. Spectral sensitivity varies by PV technology (a-Si, CIGS, etc.).
    Higher irradiance leads to higher cell temperature which impacts performance.
  6: Irradiance affects current more strongly while temperature has more of an effect
    on voltage. Solar module performance degrades at high temperatures, decreasing
    lifespan.
  7: Temperature elevation negatively impacts solar PV module performance, primarily
    through a decrease in open-circuit voltage. Power output decreases near-linearly
    with temperature. Different solar cell technologies have different temperature
    coefficients for power, voltage, and current.

    reflections, increasing captured radiation.
  12: Wind increases PV efficiency by cooling modules and reducing soiling, but extreme
    winds can compromise structural security.
  14: Hurricanes can damage modules, mounts, and wiring, disrupting power generation.
    Solar eclipses cause a rapid but short-lived fall in solar power generation. Thin-film
    cells are less prone to cracking due to lower strain levels compared to silicon
    solar cells.
  15: Climate change will increase temperatures and cloud cover, leading to more summer
    days with low PV output. Gradual shifts in atmospheric conditions (dimming and
    brightening phases) alter global horizontal irradiance (GHI) over decades.
  16: Individual and combined effects of several key factors must be understood and
    mitigated to optimize PV output.
