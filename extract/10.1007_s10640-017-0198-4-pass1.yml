  47: Scenarios of warming, different regions, temperature, sectoral changes (agriculture,

Highlights:
  1: Climate change is expected to have a moderate impact on global energy demand
    (6-11%). Climate-induced changes in energy demand are disproportionally larger
    in tropical regions. Climate change has a regressive impact on energy demand,
    with increased energy demand falling on low- and middle-income countries.
  3: Capturing the impacts of future extremes requires empirical modeling that anticipates
    the challenges that attend the projection of climate.
  4: Develops a flexible methodology to characterize geographic variations in climate
    change impacts on energy demand across the globe. Estimates the nonlinear effect
    of climate on energy use indicative of adaptation responses by final consumers.
  5: Energy demand response to temperature changes exhibits a generalized V-shape,
    with variations based on region, sector, and weather exposure.
  6: Short-run responses of energy demand to weather underestimate the potential change
    in energy demand as adaptation to climate change. Long-run effects on energy consumption
    will come from adjustments in the quantity and energy efficiency characteristics
    of the capital stock. The error correction model is used as a workaround to address
    the dichotomy between intensive and extensive margins of adaptation.
  7: "Performance depends fundamentally on weather, which we specify as the agent\u2019\
    s exposure to vectors of intervals of temperature and humidity, ET and EH. Weather\
    \ impacts are modulated by the agent\u2019s choices of space conditioning equipment,\
    \ other energy-using capital, irrigation infrastructure, building characteristics,\
    \ etc.\u2014which we indicate using the vector X ."
  8: "Partitions the influence of covariates into short- and long-run effects. Quantifies\
    \ the speed of adjustment to long-run equilibrium. Calculates the long-run demand\
    \ response as the cumulative disequilibrium demand response throughout the adjustment\
    \ period (-\u03B3/\u03B8). The coefficients are semi-elasticities indicating the\
    \ percentage change in demand due to time spent in a given temperature/humidity\
    \ interval."
  11: Most grid cells will experience increased frequency of hot days and decreased
    frequency of cold days, but the geographic incidence is uneven. The empirical
    question is the sign and magnitude of country-specific final energy demand consequences.
  14: ''
  16: Without climate change, total weather-sensitive energy demand is expected to
    reach 502 EJ by 2050, an almost five-fold increase over 2010.
  19: Positive changes in energy demand are concentrated in developing and industrializing
    economies in tropical regions, with regressive global impacts affecting low- and
    middle-income countries more.
  20: South America, Asia, and Africa see ubiquitous increases in energy demand, while
    Europe, North America, and Oceania exhibit mixed responses.
  21: The chart illustrates the impact of different warming scenarios on sectoral
    and aggregate energy demand for various G20 nations and world regions, with negative
    values indicating decreased energy consumption.
  22: Climate change is expected to increase global energy demand, but this effect
    is of secondary importance compared with the effect of economic expansion. Tropical
    countries account for most of the increase in energy consumption above business-as-usual
    levels, concentrated in industry and residential sectors.
  23: Climate change impacts on energy demand are projected to vary significantly
    across sectors, regions, and energy sources; Under RCP 8.5, the total energy demand
    for the world increases by 1.75 EJ under the current energy system but increases
    by 55.12 EJ circa 2050.
  24: "Uncertainty in income and temperature responses generates increases of 4.7-8.9%\
    \ under moderate (RCP4.5) warming, and 7.5-19.3% under rapid (RCP8.5) warming\
    \ in energy demand. The long upper tail of impacts arises purely from uncertainties\
    \ in energy consumption\u2019s responses to income and meteorology. The upper\
    \ bounds in Table 5.D may well understate the true uncertainty."
  25: Dynamic modeling approach is important, as static and first-difference models
    yield different elasticity estimates compared to dynamic models, affecting energy
    consumption projections.  Different fuels and sectors show asymmetric responses
    to hot and cold days. Income elasticities of fuel oil demand are positive.
  26: The marginal effect of temperature and humidity depends on the capital stock
    quantity. The inclusion of energy prices does not appreciably change the estimated
    temperature semi-elasticities but reduces the speed of adjustment towards equilibrium.
  27: Economic expansion increases energy demand in tropical regions up to a factor
    of 9.3, while a change in climate contributes with a factor of 1.3.
  28: The plot provides a comparative analysis of how different capital proxies and
    Real GDP per Capita are affected by different temperature ranges, shown via error
    bars representing variability or uncertainty in measurements.
  29: Climate change impacts lead to a geographic and seasonal redistribution of energy
    consumption towards tropical regions and summer months. The analysis shows that
    changes in socioeconomic and climatic conditions could significantly expand the
    use of electricity in the commercial and industrial sectors in temperate and tropical
    regions, respectively.
  30: Global energy consumption is projected to increase significantly due to climate
    change, particularly in tropical regions. Climate change impacts are regressive
    and likely to exacerbate poverty. Energy demand increases are driven by increases
    in electricity demand in industry, residential, and agriculture sectors in the
    tropics.
  31: The paper aims to address heterogeneity in demand response across sectors, fuels,
    and regions and how these responses interact with temperature data.
  39: Significant short-run and long-run impacts of extreme humidity and temperature
    on log real GDP per capita are reported, with variations across regions and sectors.
  40: Temperature changes and natural gas use have statistically significant impacts
    on log real GDP per capita in both the short-run and long-run.
  41: "Long run, log fuel oil use per capita has a statistically significant negative\
    \ impact on log real GDP per capita across all models.  Long run, T < 7.5\xB0\
    C has a statistically significant positive impact on log real GDP per capita in\
    \ some models."
  42: Some significant (p<0.05 or p<0.1) positive and negative impacts of extreme
    temperatures and humidities on Log real GDP per capita are shown, conditional
    on sector (Electricity, Fuel oil, Natural gas) and region (Temperate, Tropical,
    World).
  43: Significant relationships (p < 0.1 or p < 0.05) exist between log real GDP per
    capita and humidity/temperature variables in several models. The direction and
    magnitude of these relationships vary depending on the specific model specification.
  44: Changes in temperature and humidity can have a statistically significant short-run
    and long-run impact on GDP per capita. The direction and magnitude of the impact
    varies depending on whether the region is temperate or tropical, and on whether
    temperature and humidity are increasing or decreasing.
  45: "Short run changes in humidity (H < 4 g/kg, H > 14 g/kg) and temperature (T\
    \ < 12.5\u25E6C, T > 27.5\u25E6C) and the long run level of temperature (T > 27.5\u25E6\
    C) have a statistically significant impact on log real GDP per capita. Long run\
    \ electricity demand and long run level of GDP also have a statistically significant\
    \ impact."
  46: Temperature changes can have a significant impact on electricity demand, with
    substantial variations across tropical, temperate, and world regions. Total energy
    demand can be significantly affected, with percentage changes varying widely based
    on the scenario and region. Natural Gas and Oil appear to be less sensitive.
  47: Presents sensitivity ranges for Total GDP impact, Total Sensitivity to Temperature,
    and Total Aggregate Energy System responses under different warming scenarios.
    Shows impacts on energy demand by sector (Agriculture, Commercial, Industrial,
    Residential).
Methodology:
  1: Econometric analysis of the response of energy demand to temperature and humidity
    exposure combined with future scenarios of climate change and socioeconomic development.
  3: The paper adopts an approach that uses temporal exposure to different intervals
    of temperature to capture potential non-linearity in the responses of demand to
    temperature extremes. Earth system models (ESMs) are used to project future climate
    states. The aggregation of meteorological data across spatial and temporal scales
    is a critical issue.
  4: Econometrically disentangles the short- and long-run responses of per-capita
    energy consumption to variations in weather. Combines these estimates with ESM
    temperature projections and scenarios of population and GDP growth to elucidate
    the potential climate change impacts on final energy consumption. Uses representative
    concentration pathways (RCPs) and a shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) scenario.
  5: Empirical model development (not detailed on this page)
  6: Employs an error correction model to distinguish between short-run effects of
    weather shocks and long-run responses to climate. The theoretical framework models
    an intertemporally optimizing agent minimizing expected performance loss, which
    is a quadratic function of divergence from a target level and inter-period variability.
  7: "An error-correcting model of energy demand (Eq. 4) is estimated, where the dependent\
    \ variable is the logarithm of fuel (f) \xD7sector (s)\xD7country (i)\xD7year\
    \ (t) demand for final energy per person."
  8: Uses an error-correction model to estimate the short- and long-run effects of
    temperature and humidity exposures on energy demand. The model includes country
    fixed effects and controls for other factors (Xi,t).
  11: The change in per capita energy demand at the grid-cell level is calculated
    by combining long-run climatic estimates with synthetic historical and future
    exposure series. Country-level impact on final energy demand is found by aggregating
    across grid cells, fuels, and sectors (equation 9).
  14: The paper estimates long-run semi-elasticities of per capita final energy consumption
    to daily temperature exposure. The reported results are estimated long-run relationships
    applicable to the study's dataset and model. Equations 13a, 13b, and 13c define
    aggregate energy demand changes at the fuel, sector, and total level respectively.
  16: Empirical results are used in conjunction with SSP5 projections of per capita
    GDP growth to calculate future BaU energy consumption according to eqs. (10) and
    (11).
  19: Projected changes in energy demand calculated using econometric estimates, considering
    the character of the future energy system and fuel/sector mix.
  21: The analysis projects energy demand responses for various regions and sectors
    under different warming scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) circa 2050.
  22: "Sensitivity analysis is performed at the confidence bounds of parameter estimates\
    \ to assess the impact of uncertainty in responses to temperature and income on\
    \ impact projections (Table 4). Independence is assumed among fuel \xD7 sector\
    \ combinations, and between the responses to temperature and to GDP. The analysis\
    \ is based on point projections constructed at the means of estimated responses\
    \ to temperature and income."
  23: The analysis projects sectoral and aggregate energy demand responses based on
    warming scenarios RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, comparing current and circa 2050 energy
    systems in tropical and temperate regions and at the world level.
  24: Sensitivity analysis is performed to determine the impact of uncertainties in
    income and temperature responses on energy demand. The analysis focuses on the
    year 2050 under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios. Analysis based on a single scenario
    of economic growth, and projections of future temperature change from a single
    ESM.
  25: Estimation of static and first-difference regressions as analogues to dynamic
    models to assess the impact of different modeling approaches on elasticity estimates
    used for projecting changes in energy consumption. Using real per capita GDP as
    a proxy for capital stock adjustments.
  26: 'Panel data regression (Equation 16) with interaction terms between temperature/humidity
    and capital stock proxies. Considers lagged dependent variable and lagged explanatory
    variables. Uses four proxies for weather-exposed capital stocks: log of per capita
    GDP, log of aggregate country capital stocks, and accumulated real imports of
    heating/cooling equipment and machinery and transport equipment. Robustness checks
    with energy prices are conducted.'
  27: The analysis estimates long-run semi-elasticities using regressions with temperature
    interaction terms. The results are applicable to the long-run equilibrium.
  28: The sensitivity of marginal effect of temperature estimates to different capital
    proxies is assessed across different climate zones (Tropical, Temperate).
  29: Cross section-time series regressions to estimate short-run and long-run elasticities
    of energy demand with respect to temperature and humidity, controlling for other
    confounding factors. These elasticities are combined with scenarios of climate
    change and socioeconomic development to project future energy consumption.
  30: The paper maps the spatial distribution of future percentage change in energy
    demand for three fuels and four sectors. It calculates future percentage and absolute
    changes in energy demand due to socio-economic development and changes in climatic
    conditions globally, for different world regions, and at the country-level, circa
    2050. The response of energy demand to heat and cold is asymmetric.
  31: The paper establishes a methodology focusing on heterogeneity in demand response
    across sectors, fuels, and regions, and how those responses interact with geographically
    and temporally varying temperature data. Future climate impacts are illustrated
    using one specific ESM and socioeconomic scenario.
  39: Panel regression analysis with first differenced and lagged terms to estimate
    short-run and long-run effects. Robust standard errors are used. Results are presented
    by region (Temperate, Tropical), sector (Residential, Commercial, Industrial,
    Agriculture), and at the world level. Statistical significance is indicated by
    * and **.
  40: Panel regression with short-run (first differenced) and long-run (lagged) terms.
    Robust standard errors are used. The analysis is performed on commercial, residential
    in temperate regions, and residential in tropical regions.
  41: Panel data regression is used with short-run (first-differenced) and long-run
    (lagged) terms. The analysis is conducted separately for temperate and tropical
    regions, and across different sectors (industry, agriculture, residential).
  42: Panel regressions are performed using robust standard errors to estimate the
    impact of temperature and humidity on log real GDP per capita. The models are
    static.
  43: First difference model, robustness check using regression analysis.  The model
    examines the relationship between log real GDP per capita and humidity and temperature
    variables, controlling for various factors like electricity, region, sector, and
    fuel type.
  44: 'The analysis uses a regression model with short-run (first differenced) and
    long-run (lagged) terms. Robust standard errors are used. The models are estimated
    separately for temperate and tropical regions, and different dependent variables
    (Log real GDP per capita, machinery and transport equipment, heating and cooling
    equipment, and capital stock). Significance levels are indicated by asterisks:
    ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.'
  45: Panel data regression with first difference and lagged terms, using robust standard
    errors. The analysis includes 18 countries and 558 observations.
  47: Sensitivity analysis examining the impact of temperature and sectoral changes
    on economic outcomes like GDP and energy demand. Results are applicable circa
    2050 under RCP 4.5 and RCP Gas scenarios.
More Notes:
  1: South America, Asia, and Africa are projected to increase energy demand across
    all sectors and climate scenarios, while Europe, North America, and Oceania exhibit
    mixed responses.
  3: The paper focuses on energy demand and its sensitivity to meteorological factors,
    highlighting the importance of considering nonlinearity and data aggregation when
    projecting climate change impacts.
  4: The analysis focuses on three energy commodities (electricity, fuel oil, and
    natural gas) in four economic sectors (residential, commercial, industrial, agriculture).
    A more comprehensive assessment of different climate and socio-economic trends
    is left to future work.
  5: The paper focuses on the relationship between temperature and energy demand,
    which can indirectly influence macroeconomic outcomes via energy costs and availability.
  6: The theoretical framework is deliberately simple.
  7: Relative humidity is a better indicator of the demand for cooling to counteract
    heat stress because it accounts for the attenuation of evaporative cooling through
    perspiration. Notwithstanding this, we use specific humidity because it is less
    correlated with temperature.
  11: The paper acknowledges a shortcoming in using current energy consumption as
    the base, as the future global energy system is likely to differ substantially
    from the present. The method assumes that sub-national per capita energy demand
    is uniformly distributed and equal to the national average.
  14: The paper focuses on the energy demand response to temperature variations and
    its impact on GDP. It doesn't directly address all macroeconomic or macro-fiscal
    risks of climate change or the costs and benefits of adaptation, but it does provides
    a quantitative link between temperature, energy consumption and GDP.
  16: The 2050 fuel mix is projected to be more skewed toward electricity (68%). Tropical
    countries adjust energy consumption to weather shocks more quickly than temperate
    countries. Long-run demand responses to temperature exceed short-run counterparts.
  20: The histograms illustrate the distribution of exposed populations by income
    level in relation to percentage change in energy consumption under different warming
    scenarios, although the details of these distributions are not thoroughly discussed
    in the text.
  21: The sectors analyzed include Agriculture, Commercial, Industrial, Residential,
    and Total.
  22: The sensitivity analysis focuses on the impact of uncertainty in climate response
    on energy consumption.
  23: The data suggests a shift in energy demand across sectors and a potential regional
    disparity with Tropical regions showing more considerable increase in energy demands
    than Temperate regions, particularly by 2050. The negative numbers indicate reduced
    energy demand. The study assumes a specific energy system circa 2050. The table
    focuses exclusively on energy demand changes and does not directly translate these
    changes into GDP effects, productivity loss, or fiscal outcomes, but these could
    be inferred from the energy demand changes.
  24: The effects of GDP and temperature response uncertainties are not additive.
    Panel C shows effect of uncertainty in the temperature response at mean income
    elasticities amplifies the impact relative to the effect of income uncertainty.
  25: The study attempts to address the effect of extensive margin adjustments arising
    from changes in the quantity and/or quality of stocks of energy-using durables
    by using real per capita GDP as a proxy for capital stock.
  26: "The study focuses on the fuel\xD7sector combination with the largest number\
    \ of observations, residential electricity consumption."
  27: Price-driven energy demand adjustments (passive general equilibrium adaptations)
    may have masked about 13% of the long-run impact of heat in temperate countries.
    Residential electricity impacts in temperate countries should be interpreted as
    a lower bound.
  28: The capital proxies used are Aggregate Capital Stock, Heating/Cooling Equipment,
    and Machinery/Transport Equipment.
  29: The analysis focuses on energy demand at a sectoral level, showing heterogeneity
    across sectors that are masked in aggregate analyses.
  30: The estimates should be interpreted as potential changes, because barriers to
    energy access or to expanding energy use have not been considered.
  31: The analysis uses global statistics on energy demand by sector but cannot explicitly
    associate estimated changes in energy consumption to specific end-use services.
  39: The dependent variable is "Log electricity use per capita".
  40: The table shows results from a regression analysis specifically focusing on
    the impact of temperature and natural gas use on economic output. The analysis
    distinguishes between short-run and long-run effects and is conducted separately
    for commercial sectors globally and residential sectors in temperate and tropical
    regions. Significance levels are indicated by asterisks.
  41: The R-squared values are relatively low, suggesting that the models explain
    only a small portion of the variation in log real GDP per capita. The number of
    countries included in each regression varies.  The dependent variable in all regressions
    is the change in log real GDP per capita.
  42: The table is from a robustness check of a static model. The different columns
    (1-14) likely represent different model specifications or samples.
  43: The table presents results from various regression models with different combinations
    of regions (Temperate, Tropical, World), sectors (Residential, Industry, Agriculture,
    Commercial), electricity, and fuel types (Fuel oil, Natural gas).  Coefficients
    and standard errors for different humidity and temperature thresholds are presented.  The
    constant term and R-squared values are also reported for each model.
  44: The dependent variable 'z' changes in the different columns of the table; it
    can be Log real GDP per capita, machinery and transport equipment, heating and
    cooling equipment, and capital stock.
  47: The information is presented in ranges, suggesting uncertainty in the estimated
    impacts. The analysis considers both world and tropical/temperate regions.

    warming scenarios, respectively, due to climate change impacts on today's energy
    system. Climate change can increase global demand for energy by 55 EJ. Uncertainty
    in climate response can result in -1.2% to 2.2% (2.5% to 3.8%) change of current
    world energy consumption in the RCP 4.5 (RCP 8.5) scenario.
  23: The table provides quantitative estimates of changes in energy demand (in EJ)
    for different sectors and energy sources under different warming scenarios for
    tropical, temperate, and world regions for "current" conditions (presumably a
    baseline) and circa 2050.
  24: 'Table 5 provides sensitivity analysis of sectoral and aggregate energy demand
    responses (in EJ) under different warming scenarios circa 2050, considering different
    sensitivities: A. Current energy system sensitivity to temperature elasticities;
    B. 2050 energy system sensitivity to GDP elasticity; C. 2050 energy system sensitivity
    to temperature elasticities; D. 2050 energy system sensitivity to GDP and temperature
    elasticities. The values are provided as ranges for Agriculture, Commercial, Industrial,
    Residential and Total energy demand.'
  25: The first difference estimates substantially understate long-run results, and
    are comparable in magnitude to short-run semi-elasticities. The static estimates
    in some cases overstate and in others understate long-run responses.
  26: Long-run semi-elasticities are reported in Table 6
  27: Table 6 presents long-run estimated semi-elasticities (90% confidence intervals)
    of energy demand to temperature bins with interaction terms. Includes semi-elasticities
    for log real GDP per capita, aggregate capital stock, heating/cooling equipment,
    and machinery/transport equipment in temperate and tropical countries, with respect
    to temperature bins.
  28: "The X-axis provides a numerical scale running from 0.000 to 0.015, which quantifies\
    \ the marginal effect of temperature estimates sensitivity to different capital\
    \ proxies. The data is presented for Tropical (T>27.5\xB0C), Temperate (27.5\xB0\
    C>T>12.5\xB0C), and Temperate (T<12.5\xB0C) climate zones."
  29: Global demand for air conditioning could expand by a factor of 20 in 2050 (even
    assuming a constant climate). Overall percentage increase in total final energy
    consumption in tropical regions (26%) is greater than temperate countries (0.19%).
    15% reduction in residential sector energy consumption and a 16% increase in commercial
    sector energy consumption in temperate regions.
  30: Global energy consumption will increase by 6% and 11% under moderate (RCP4.5)
    and more significant (RCP8.5) warming, respectively, driven by tropical regions
    (16% and 26%, respectively).
  39: Regression coefficients and standard errors for the impact of temperature and
    humidity on log real GDP per capita, separated by short-run (first differenced)
    and long-run (lagged) terms. R-squared values and number of observations are also
    provided.

    ranges and natural gas use on log real GDP per capita.
  41: Regression coefficients are provided for the relationship between temperature,
    fuel oil use, and log real GDP per capita, along with robust standard errors and
    significance levels (p < 0.05, p < 0.1).
  42: Coefficients and standard errors for the impact of the humidity and temperature
    variables on log real GDP per capita are reported in the table. R-squared, observations,
    and country counts are also provided.
  43: Regression coefficients, standard errors (in parentheses), significance levels
    (* p < 0.1, ** p < 0.05), R-squared values, number of observations, number of
    countries.
  44: The table provides regression coefficients and standard errors for the impact
    of temperature and humidity variables on log real GDP per capita, as well as coefficients
    for lagged electricity use and GDP.
  45: The table provides coefficients, standard errors, and significance levels for
    the relationship between log real GDP per capita and various climate-related variables.
  46: Elasticities of energy demand (Oil, Natural Gas) and sensitivity of electricity
    demand and total energy demand to temperature changes, presented as ranges of
    percentage changes for various scenarios and regions for 2050.
  47: Provides ranges for GDP effects, energy demand, and related elasticities under
    different warming scenarios and for different regions. Also presents sensitivity
    analysis.
