Drivers of Risk:
  2: Changes in temperature anomalies due to global warming, which is a function of
    current economic growth.
  3: Changes in temperature anomalies due to emissions of Greenhouse gases resulting
    from economic growth
  4: Changes in temperature anomalies (climate change factor), which are tied to economic
    growth rates.
  5: "Changes in temperature anomalies (\u2206 TA) drive macroeconomic risk."
  6: "Climate change, specifically changes in temperature anomalies as a positive\
    \ function of current economic growth, leading to a fraction of production being\
    \ lost (\u03BB t)"
  10: "\u2206 TA (Change in Temperature Anomaly), \u2206 TA Volatility (Volatility\
    \ in Change in Temperature Anomaly), Growth Volatility"
  12: "Growth t-1 (Lagged GDP growth) and \u2206 TA t-1 to \u2206 TA t-18 (Lagged\
    \ values of the fiscal outcome itself)"
Highlights:
  2: Economic growth can lead to rapid global warming, which can result in fluctuating
    divergent balanced growth.
  3: Convergent and divergent oscillatory growth dynamics arise depending on the strength
    of the response of changes in temperature anomalies to current economic growth.
  4: Higher economic growth is associated with temperature changes leading to output
    loss from global warming.
  5: "Changes in temperature anomalies negatively impact economic growth and that\
    \ fitted economic growth consistently increases \u2206 TA."
  6: Climate change, modeled as temperature anomaly changes linked to economic growth,
    can lead to either convergent or divergent oscillatory growth dynamics.
  10: "Changes in temperature anomaly (\u2206 TA) and its volatility significantly\
    \ impact economic growth, but the magnitude and direction of the effect can vary\
    \ between Advanced Economies (AEs) and Emerging and Developing Countries (EDCs)."
  12: "Lagged values of the fiscal outcome (\u2206 TA) at t-1, t-2, t-9, and t-12\
    \ are statistically significant, as well as growth at t-1 with varying levels\
    \ of statistical significance. The coefficients vary in sign and magnitude."
Methodology:
  2: Overlapping generations endogenous growth model with climate change specified
    as a fraction of output lost due to temperature anomalies. Empirical analysis
    using data from 167 countries from 1851 to 2018.
  3: Develops an overlapping generations (OLG) endogenous growth model characterized
    by climate change to analyse the growth dynamics.
  4: "The analysis employs a macroeconomic model that incorporates a production function\
    \ with a climate change factor, \u03BB, impacting output based on temperature\
    \ anomalies and economic growth."
  5: Fixed-effects estimation involving 167 countries over the annual period of 1851
    to 2018. The growth rate of these countries is based on the per-capita real Gross
    Domestic Product (GDP) derived from the 2020 Maddison Project Database.
  6: Overlapping generations endogenous growth model; fixed-effects panel data estimation
    of 167 countries (1851-2018) vindicates the model's assumption about the endogenous
    effect of economic growth on temperature anomalies.
  10: "Panel data estimation with two stages: first stage estimating the impact of\
    \ climate and economic variables on growth, and second stage estimating the impact\
    \ of fitted growth on \u2206 TA."
  12: Reverse-MIDAS (Mixed Data Sampling) regression.
More Notes:
  2: The model suggests that policy makers should ensure economic growth is 'green'
    to avoid negative growth outcomes from global warming.
  3: The model endogenizes the fraction of output lost due to climate change by making
    it a function of current economic growth itself.
  5: "The analysis controls for volatilities of \u2206 TA and economic growth, capturing\
    \ second-moment effects (uncertainties) using a Generalized Autoregressive Conditional\
    \ Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model."
  6: "The responsiveness of temperature anomalies to economic growth determines whether\
    \ the growth path is convergent or divergent. Higher A and/or (1 - \u03B1) values\
    \ make divergent oscillations more likely, given similar temperature anomaly response."
  10: The table presents coefficients and standard errors, along with significance
    levels denoted by asterisks. The classification of countries follows the IMF.
  12: The table presents results from a regression where the dependent variable is
    the change in something labeled TA at time t. The lagged effects of both GDP growth
    and past changes in TA are explored. The time period to which these results are
    applicable is not stated.

  5: "\u2206 TA tends to negatively impact economic growth at least at the 5% level\
    \ of significance."
  10: "A 1 unit increase in \u2206 TA is associated with a statistically significant\
    \ decrease in growth. The magnitude of this decrease is approximately 0.004 across\
    \ all, AEs, and EDCs samples. The volatility of \u2206 TA also has statistically\
    \ significant effects on growth, with varying signs and magnitudes depending on\
    \ the sample (All, AEs, EDCs). Similarly, growth volatility also has a small,\
    \ statistically significant effect on growth."
