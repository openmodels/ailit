Drivers of Risk:
  1: Regional climate variations (temperature and precipitation) in distinct agricultural
    regions and seasons.
  2: Shocks impacting outcomes include climate patterns, weather, market, and policy
    fluctuations, with specific references to extreme weather events such as severe
    droughts and floods.
  3: Regional climate variability (temperature and precipitation anomalies) and changes,
    including warmer autumns, cooler springs, heat stress, and altered water availability.
  4: Temperature and precipitation variations, specifically seasonal changes; warmer
    winter temperatures leading to snow melt and depleted soil moisture; increased
    summer rainfall in certain regions.
  5: Regional climate variations, climate trends, future climate changes (increased
    warming, decreased water availability, enhanced extremes), policy interventions,
    production of oil crops, mandate-driven demand for biofuels impacting land use.
  6: The decline in TFP is largely driven by projected climate changes, including
    warmer summers in the Midwest, warmer autumns in the Southwest, warmer springs
    in the Southwest, and warmer summers in California and Nevada.
  9: Temperature (TA, TN, TM), Precipitation (PR), Shift in sectoral contributions
    to TFP (crops vs. livestock)
  10: The primary drivers of risk are climate change impacts, specifically projected
    increases in autumn and summer temperatures in specific regions of the US, spring
    temperature increases in the Southwest, and changes in precipitation patterns,
    including decreased amount and increased variability.
  11: Climate change impacts on US agriculture, specifically changes in temperature
    and precipitation; decreased availability of irrigation water
  12: Changes in climate variables across seasons (Winter (DJF), Spring (MAM), Summer
    (JJA), Autumn (SON))
  13: Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns across different seasons and
    time periods.
  14: RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate scenarios.
Highlights:
  1: The aggregate effects of regional climate trends on TFP have been outweighed
    by improvements in technology, but projected climate changes could significantly
    reduce TFP in the future.
  2: The study points to climate variability as a significant factor affecting TFP
    growth variability and suggests the need to understand these dynamics for sustainable
    agricultural policy.
  3: TFPC became much more sensitive to climate variability in 1981-2010 compared
    to 1951-1980; Geographic patterns of climate-TFPC correlations changed substantially
    between the two periods; Warmer autumns were associated with higher agricultural
    productivity in the earlier period, while cooler temperatures in the US agricultural
    heartland were associated with higher productivity in the later period.
  4: Climate dependence of US agricultural productivity significantly increased after
    1980. Positive temperature correlations with TFPC weakened over time, while negative
    correlations strengthened.
  5: TFPC sensitivity to climate variables has greatly increased in recent times.
    Projected decline in TFP relative to 2005 under both RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios
    by 2050, with a more pronounced decline under RCP 8.5. Variability in agricultural
    TFP growth is closely linked to climate variability in important crop-producing
    areas.
  6: Significant adaptation and technological advances are needed to maintain current
    US agricultural productivity levels in face of climate penalties.
  9: "TFPC sensitivity to climate is radically enhanced in 1981\u20132010 compared\
    \ with the earlier period (1951-1980). Summer temperatures have the largest negative\
    \ correlations with TFPC in the later period. Change in sectoral contributions\
    \ to TFP, especially the increasing importance of crop production, likely caused\
    \ TFPC sensitivity to increase."
  10: The future climate penalty reduces TFP at greater rates than it has grown in
    recent decades, and the rate of loss increases significantly over time. Productivity
    appears to be significantly more sensitive than previous studies have shown yield
    to be.
  11: Irrigation has historically buffered regional productivity from precipitation
    changes, but future TFP reductions may exceed model predictions due to less plentiful
    and sustainable water sources; adaptation strategies (improved technology or changed
    practices) could lower TFP losses, but are not accounted for in the model; regulatory
    effects (e.g., PIK program, biofuel mandates) could impact TFP, but the general
    effect is not well established; climate-induced drops in US agricultural TFP could
    impact international trade in coarse grains.
  12: There is a shift towards more grids with positive correlations (hotter temperatures)
    during 1981-2010 compared to 1951-1980 indicating an increase in warmer temperatures.
  13: There are variations in the contribution of agricultural sectors to total value
    in the US. Crops constitute the majority of agricultural value, livestock shows
    a slightly decreasing trend, and farm-related goods and services are increasing
    in importance. Temperature and precipitation changes show trends over time and
    may affect the agriculture sector.
  14: The bar graph shows percentage changes in TFP under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios
    over time, with reductions occurring across all scenarios and time periods. The
    reductions are especially significant in the 2030-2040 interval under RCP8.5.
Methodology:
  1: Multivariate regression model predicting the growth of agricultural TFP based
    on a physical understanding of its historical relationship with climate.
  2: The analysis uses historical records of TFP and examines the correlation of national
    TFPC with seasonal and geographic climate variables using regression analysis.
  3: Correlation analysis between regional climate indices (temperature and precipitation)
    and national TFPC over two periods (1951-1980 and 1981-2010).
  4: Regression models were developed for two periods (1951-1980 and 1981-2010) to
    capture TFPC-climate relationships using seasonal temperature and precipitation
    averages over 10 significant regions.
  5: "Regression analysis (model 2) to evaluate potential TFPC responses to projected\
    \ future climate changes, assuming effects of technological advances and adaptation\
    \ practices remain the same as in 1981\u20132010. Future TFP variations projected\
    \ through 2050 based on all available future climate realizations for both RCP4.5\
    \ and RCP8.5."
  6: The analysis uses Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) simulations
    and assessments of climate sensitivity variations among models to evaluate climate
    impacts on TFP.
  9: Correlation analysis between TFPC and climate variables in two periods (1951-1980
    and 1981-2010), CMIP5 climate simulations used to project future climate change
    under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios and their influence on TFPC.
  10: The analysis uses a TFPC model representing the observed relationships between
    the US agricultural economy and climate variations as an analog to project future
    productivity change. Rates are calculated as compound annual growth rates from
    2010 to 2040. The model is built on observed regional climate anomalies, which
    are linked to measured economic responses.
  11: "Uses Lasso Regression Analysis to model the relationship between climate indices\
    \ and Total Factor Productivity (TFPC) in US agriculture, reducing overfitting\
    \ possible in the stepwise regression. The stepwise regression analysis involved\
    \ including climate indices (eight for 1981\u20132010 and four for 1951\u2013\
    1980) and minimizing the residual sum of squares."
  12: Correlation analysis between climate variables and TFPC over US land grids,
    comparing two time periods.
  13: Correlation analysis between total factor productivity of crops (TFPC) and climate
    variables (temperature and precipitation); Analysis of the contribution of different
    agricultural sectors to total value.
  14: Regression analysis based on 28-year submodels used to generate uncertainty
    ranges. Climate projections uncertainty range is based on the 25th and 75th percentile
    GCM results.
More Notes:
  3: The study identifies key regions where regional climate indices significantly
    affect national TFPC; The relationships between climate and TFPC vary by season
    and region; the impact of climate on agriculture is mediated by crop type and
    growing conditions.
  4: Agricultural productivity has become more sensitive to climate in recent years.
  5: Analysis assumes agricultural producers will respond to future climate changes
    as they currently do to interannual climate variations. Policy interventions can
    significantly impact measured agricultural productivity.
  6: Model uncertainties are noted due to climate projections and sampling errors
    in the regression model; technological advances are treated as constants in the
    projections.
  9: The study focuses on the US agricultural sector. The analysis considers the impact
    of climate variation on TFPC.
  10: The model's applicability may decrease as future climate changes exceed the
    magnitude of historical anomalies. The study finds TFP loss may be higher than
    yield loss because it reflects the added costs of maintaining yield under less
    beneficial climate conditions. The paper identifies factors contributing to TFP
    loss, including warming trends and precipitation changes.
  11: The analysis is based on averaged TFPC-climate relationship observed in 1981-2010,
    and doesn't account for evolving climate sensitivity; Trade regulations may indirectly
    affect agriculture; There was no persistent correlation found between agricultural
    international trade and TFPC in US agriculture.
  13: The paper focuses on agriculture in the US. The analysis is based on historical
    data from 1951 to 2010 for climate variables and 1951 to 2001 for agricultural
    value. The study seems to relate climate variability to agricultural productivity
    but only shows correlations, not causal effects, in this page.

    represents around 70% of variance. Correlation coefficients between modeled and
    measured TFPC are provided for both periods (R=0.702 and R=0.839 respectively).
  5: Climate trends caused a net TFP loss of 0.0003846 per year, outweighed by a technological
    gain of 0.014865 per year. PIK program caused a drastic reduction in productivity
    by close to 15 to 16%.
  6: TFP decline projected to occur by ~2035 for RCP4.5 and ~2040 for RCP8.5 if technological
    advancements and adaptation only keep pace with recent rates.
  9: Significant correlations between TFPC and climate indicators (TA, TN, TM, PR)
    expressed as percentages of grids, changes in sectoral contributions to TFP (crops,
    livestock, farm-related goods and services) as percentages of total value.
  10: Under the RCP4.5 scenario, the ensemble mean climate penalty will reduce TFP
    by ~2.84% per year through 2040, with a range of 1.75% to 5.19% per year considering
    climate projection uncertainty. From 2010-2020 the mean loss rate is 0.69% per
    year, rising to 2.40% in 2020-2030, and 5.38% in 2030-2040. Using regression-based
    uncertainty, average yearly losses from 2010-2040 are 2.97%, with a range of 1.48%
    to 5.60%. Under the RCP8.5 scenario, the mean loss rate is 4.34% per year, or
    between 2.52% and 13.32% per year considering climate uncertainty. This rate increases
    over time from 1.37% per year in 2010-2020 to 3.26% in 2020-2030 and 8.25% from
    2030-2040. Submodel results increase the mean projected TFP loss to 4.55% per
    year, with a climate-based uncertainty range of 2.17 to 14.43%.
