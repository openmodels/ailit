Drivers of Risk:
  1: Intensification of very wet monsoon seasons, shift from days with light rainfall
    to days with moderate or heavy rainfall, increasing number of wet days
  3: Severe floods on large scales
  4: Unabated climate change (SSP5-8.5)
  5: Increase of very wet Indian summer monsoon (ISM) seasons due to climate change
    (SSP5-8.5, SSP2-4.5, SSP1-2.6).
Highlights:
  1: The study projects an intensification of very wet monsoon seasons in India under
    global warming, leading to more frequent and intense rainfall events, even modest
    mitigation efforts will have a strong impact on extreme rainfall seasons.
  3: The multi-model average shows an increase in the seasonal mean precipitation
    under the SSP5-8.5 scenario.
  4: General shift of precipitation distribution toward wetter seasons; dry seasons
    projected to be rarer.
  5: Under SSP5-8.5, the increasing trend becomes significant in 2027.
Methodology:
  1: Analysis using the latest generation of coupled climate models (CMIPs) with improved
    performance regarding the Indian monsoon.
  3: "Analysis of wet seasons is performed using individual grids of each model, standardized\
    \ to a 1\xB0 \xD7 1\xB0 latitude/longitude grid by first order conservative remapping\
    \ for spatial analysis. Monthly data is used for ISM seasons, daily data for subseasonal\
    \ analysis. Mean monsoon rainfall calculated by averaging monthly rainfall data\
    \ from June-September (JJAS) over the region of interest. Compares rainfall in\
    \ 2050\u20132100 to a baseline period of 1965\u20132015. Defines very wet monsoon\
    \ seasons by the 90%-percentile (1-in-10-years monsoon season). Classifies daily\
    \ rainfall amount and calculates the Simple Daily Intensity Index (SDII)."
  4: Analysis based on CMIP6 models, historical data from 1965-2015, future projections
    for 2050-2100. Focuses on rainfall, does not consider evaporation.
  5: Use 32 CMIP6 models to analyze the future frequency of very strong rainfall seasons.
More Notes:
  1: The projections depend on the determination of humankind to reduce carbon emissions
    and implement mitigation measures.
  3: "Focuses on the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) region (longitude 67\xB0\u201398\xB0\
    E and latitude 6\xB0\u201336\xB0N)."
  4: Particularly the Himalayan region, Bangladesh, the west coast and central India
    are projected to intensify most.
  5: Regarding moderate rainfall days (40mm > x > 10 mm), the multi-model mean suggests
    an increase in most areas, while in Bhutan and South Pakistan a decrease is projected.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Agricultural yield's sensitivity to monsoon rainfall variability, impacts on
    crop yields, food security, water management, and the country's economy
  3: Impact on the Indian food production and the Gross Domestic Product
  4: No relevant information
  5: No relevant information
Quantitative material:
  1: "Very wet monsoon seasons (like those observed in 5 years during 1965-2015) are\
    \ projected to occur 8 times more often in 2050\u20132100 under SSP5-8.5, and\
    \ 6 times more frequent under SSP2-4.5."
  3: Under the SSP5-8.5 scenario, the multi-model average shows an increase in the
    seasonal mean precipitation (6.8 mm/day) as compared to the historical period
    (5.6 mm/day). Taking only the models with a reasonably good representation of
    the ISM into consideration, the increase is from 6.2 mm/day to 7.3 mm/day. In
    the modest mitigation scenario (SSP2-4.5), the historic seasonal mean increases
    to 6.3 mm/day averaging over all models
  4: Increase to 6.2 mm/day in SSP1-2.6; standard deviation of seasonal monsoon precipitation
    increases in SSP5-8.5 (increased interannual variability); significant increase
    beyond observed natural variability emerges in 2027, which accelerates non-linearly
  5: Projects an increase of 0-2.5 days per season in heavy rainfall days (>40mm)
    specifically in the Western Ghats, South coast of Bangladesh and the Himalayan
    region.
