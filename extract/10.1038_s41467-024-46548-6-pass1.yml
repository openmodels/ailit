Drivers of Risk:
  1: The drivers of risk are sea-level rise (SLR) and storms.
  2: Sea level rise (SLR), storm risk, beach erosion, and the interplay between coastal
    systems and economic behavior.
  4: Sea Level Rise (SLR) beginning at year 50, beach erosion.
  5: Sea-level rise (SLR) and reduction in beach nourishment subsidies are the drivers
    of risk.
  6: Sea Level Rise (SLR) and changes in outside market appreciation.
  7: Sea level rise (SLR) beginning at t=50 years.
  8: Sea level rise is the primary driver of risk. Other drivers include tax policy,
    outside markets (non-coastal real estate), beach nourishment subsidies, macroeconomic
    shocks, and tax reform.
  9: Drivers of risk include erosion, sea-level rise, storms, flood hazards, and changes
    in coastal amenities.
  12: The drivers of risk considered include storm frequency (parameterized by storm
    return interval), sea level rise (parameterized by property elevation relative
    to sea level), and proximity to the oceanfront.
  13: The risk drivers include decisions around beach nourishment and factors like
    anticipated nourishment costs and beach width.
Evaluation overview:

  8: The paper evaluates the persistence of high property values and socioeconomic
    composition in coastal areas vulnerable to sea level rise (SLR), with a focus
    on gentrification and demographic shifts.
  9: This paper evaluates impacts to property values and housing markets.
  12: This paper evaluates property prices in coastal real estate markets.
  13: The analysis evaluates the outcome of property values concerning shoreline management
    and nourishment plans.
Highlights:
  1: Policy and market forces delay real estate price declines on the US coast, but
    these effects are temporary and only delay precipitous declines as total inundation
    approaches. Removing subsidies would more accurately reflect risks but also trigger
    more coastal gentrification. There is a policy tradeoff between slowing demographic
    transitions and allowing property markets to adjust smoothly to risks from climate
    change.
  2: Properties vulnerable to SLR are discounted relative to comparable properties.
    Housing markets capitalize storm risks in the short run, but price discounts dissipate
    within several years of a storm. Subsidies for coastal management, tax advantages
    for high-income property owners, and stable property values outside the coastal
    zone all dampen the impacts of SLR on coastal property markets; the effects are
    transitory and only delay price declines as total inundation approaches.
  4: SLR initially has a mild impact on housing risk. High-income agents entering
    the market can temporarily dampen the property value decline. Property values
    decline immediately if high-income agents are not allowed to enter. The investor
    market share declines to zero as property values decline more substantially.
  5: Reduced nourishment subsidies lead to volatility in property values followed
    by a precipitous decline. Mean beach width declines immediately without the subsidy
    but levels off. The median owner income tax rate increases. Investors own substantially
    less of the housing.
  6: Rising outside markets cause coastal real estate prices to appreciate even after
    SLR begins, delaying the effect on beach width. Rising prices drive investors
    out of the market. Removing subsidies is offset by rising outside markets in the
    long run. Declining outside markets can reverse the influx of high-income agents.
  7: Coastal property values can continue to rise despite increasing climate-related
    risks due to factors like beach nourishment and wealthier residents moving in
    (coastal gentrification). When outside markets decline, expected returns and property
    values plummet, investors buy real estate and rent to lower-income occupants.
  8: High-income owners are tax advantaged, which acts as a subsidy and contributes
    to high property values. Beach nourishment subsidies delay downward adjustments
    of prices in response to SLR and demographic shifts. The same community can experience
    both coastal gentrification and climate gentrification during distinct periods
    of time. Lower-income households face greater risks of losing home equity due
    to climate-related flooding.
  9: Public investments in adaptation and risk mitigation capitalize into real estate
    prices. Federal subsidies can even create bubbles in coastal real estate.
  12: The model incorporates both short-term (herding) and long-term (arbitrage) feedbacks
    influencing coastal property values. These feedbacks drive adjustments in agent
    income and willingness-to-pay distributions. The model captures how coastal property
    values deviate from external market benchmarks due to these dynamics.
Methodology:
  1: The analysis is performed using the Coastal Home Ownership Model (C-HOM), incorporating
    changing physical attributes of the coast, economic values of these attributes,
    and dynamic risks associated with storms and flooding; it analyzes the long-term
    evolution of coastal real estate markets.
  2: A hedonic price function is used to estimate the natural log of property sales
    price, controlling for property characteristics. The regression was run in Stata/SE
    18.0 using 23,184,659 observations of property sales in the United States between
    1989 and 2016. Coupled human and natural systems modeling is highlighted as a
    method to understand the mechanisms driving empirical phenomena.
  4: Agent-based model simulation of oceanfront and non-oceanfront properties. Assumes
    SLR begins at t=50 and continues. Baseline case assumes subsidized beach nourishment,
    constant outside property prices, and agent flux. A scenario is also tested where
    agent flux is not allowed.
  5: Numerical experiment simulating a cut in the nourishment subsidy rate to 50%
    at the onset of SLR (t=50) is performed. The results are model simulation differences
    between the baseline model (90% nourishment subsidy) and the altered subsidy scenario.
    Outcomes are shown for oceanfront and non-oceanfront properties.
  6: 'Numerical experiment comparing a baseline model to scenarios with appreciating
    outside markets. SLR begins at t=50. Compares a world with rising outside markets
    and SLR to a world with constant outside markets and no SLR. Also models cases
    with reduced subsidies and declining outside markets. '
  7: Model simulations of a coupled human-natural system applied to coastal real estate
    markets, incorporating beach erosion dynamics, local public finance decisions,
    storm risk, and demographic changes, examining the impact of SLR. The baseline
    scenario assumes constant outside markets for the first 50 years after the onset
    of SLR, then a decline to 10% of initial levels over the following 50 years.
  8: The paper uses a coupled human-natural system model (C-HOM) to compare different
    coastal management approaches and their equity implications. The results are applicable
    to understanding the dynamics of coastal property markets and community composition
    under SLR.
  9: This paper uses a coupled human-natural systems model (C-HOM) that combines agent-based
    modeling with asset-price modeling and considers feedbacks between the natural
    environment and human decisions (e.g., beach nourishment). It considers heterogeneous
    agents with different perceptions of risk and uses finite-time forecasts. The
    model incorporates amenity values and climate risks based on empirical valuation
    studies. The analysis is applicable to coastal housing markets.
  12: The analysis uses an agent-based model to simulate coastal real estate markets
    over long time horizons. The model incorporates demographic changes, interactions
    with outside markets (to benchmark agent parameter distributions), and heterogeneous
    expectations of capital gains. Agent parameter distributions are updated based
    on arbitrage opportunities with outside market property values. It appears applicable
    to US coastal real estate markets.
  13: The analysis uses simulations in MATLAB to model investment decisions, property
    values, and nourishment plans, incorporating a property tax adjustment framework.
More Notes:
  4: The initial barrier height is 1 meter for the first 50 years. The initial 50-year
    period characterizes the system without SLR.
  5: The baseline demonstrates that property value does not immediately reflect SLR
    risks due to interactions between risk, investment, and income. Arbitrage opportunities
    help to maintain high prices initially. Tax advantages allow investors to capitalize
    on high willingness to pay for oceanfront living.
  6: Results are presented as model simulation differences between scenarios. Nourishment
    frequency and beach width increase relative to the baseline when housing prices
    rise. Self-financing of nourishment becomes sufficient when property values rise
    after subsidy removal.
  8: The paper raises questions about how public funds could be spent differently
    to promote adaptation, suggesting that subsidies for beach nourishment are maladaptive.
    Buyouts with rentbacks, and investments in different technologies for living on
    the coast, might be better approaches.
  9: The paper suggests that current incentives may reinforce excess durability in
    the coastal zone, and that public investments that subsidize shoreline stabilization
    may be better spent on incentives for adaptive housing technology. Future studies
    could consider race as an indicator of coastal gentrification and allow costs
    to rise with cumulative sand use from beach nourishment.
  12: The paper introduces a risk factor (rOF) for oceanfront property and parameterizes
    other physical risks (storms, SLR) similarly for both oceanfront and non-oceanfront
    properties. It uses Beta distributions to model agent parameters (income, willingness
    to pay). Agent adjustment is based on the difference between coastal property
    values and the external market value.
Quantitative material:
  1: Coastal real estate has been appreciating faster than non-coastal real estate;
    properties vulnerable to flooding have inflated prices relative to market fundamentals.
  2: Figure 1 shows quality-adjusted baseline housing values in coastal and inland
    counties in the United States from 2000 to 2015.
  4: Property values decline modestly when SLR begins, but a substantial decline takes
    decades to manifest. SLR begins at year 50 and rises 1m over the remaining 100
    years. By year 150, the barrier height relative to mean sea level is 0m. Beach
    nourishment is subsidized at 90% of the cost.
  5: Percent change in property value, change in beach width (m), difference in income
    tax rate, and difference in investor market share are quantified.
  6: Percent change in property value for oceanfront and non-oceanfront properties;
    difference in beach width (m); difference in income tax rate; difference in investor
    market share are quantified as a function of time since SLR begins.
  7: Model simulations show how oceanfront property values plummet sharply when outside
    markets decline after SLR begins. Investor share of housing increases as high-income
    owners leave the market.
  8: Mentions cumulative federal expenditures on beach nourishment projects have exceeded
    12 billion USD in the past century (in 2022 dollars).
  9: The paper incorporates empirical valuation studies in environmental economics
    related to coastal amenities and risks.
  12: The paper presents equations for risk factors related to storms (r_St), sea
    level rise (r_SLt), and adjustments to agent distributions based on market dynamics.
    It also includes equations for the upper limits of willingness to pay (WTP) and
    the beach width scaling parameter (alpha) as they adjust based on external market
    conditions.
