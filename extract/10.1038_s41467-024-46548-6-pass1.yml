Drivers of Risk:
  1: Sea-level rise (SLR) and storms.
  3: Sea level rise, storm risk, competing property markets (outside property markets)
  4: Sea level rise (SLR) starting at year 50 and rising 1 meter over 100 years, impacting
    the physical and economic conditions of oceanfront areas.
  5: Sea Level Rise (SLR) and Nourishment Subsidy (specifically, a cut in the subsidy
    rate).
  6: Sea level rise (SLR), Appreciation/decline in outside markets (markets external
    to the coastal area).
  7: Sea level rise (SLR), decline in outside markets.
  10: Climate change impacts on coastal housing markets, specifically storm risk and
    beach erosion.
  11: Sea level rise, storms, and erosion of beaches are drivers of risk that are
    explicitly modeled. Climate beliefs and risk tolerance also factor into the risks.
  12: Sea level rise (SLR), Storms
  13: Shoreline retreat rate, sea-level rise (inferred through its impact on beach
    width), climate change (captured in risk parameters).
  15: Climate change, sea-level rise, flood hazards, and shoreline changes.
Highlights:
  1: Subsidies for coastal management, tax advantages for high-income property owners,
    and stable or increasing property values outside the coastal zone all dampen the
    effects of SLR on coastal property values, but these effects are temporary and
    only delay precipitous declines as total inundation approaches. Removing subsidies
    would more accurately reflect risks from SLR but also trigger more coastal gentrification.
  3: Study the evolution of coastal real estate markets, incomes of residents, and
    shoreline management decisions in response to SLR over a 150-year time horizon
    by developing the Coastal Home Ownership Model (C-HOM).
  4: Increased risk from SLR eventually leads to property value decline, initially
    mitigated by high-income agents maintaining property values through market influx.
  5: Cutting nourishment subsidies leads to property value decline, reduced beach
    width, increased income tax rate for property owners, and decreased investor share
    of housing.
  6: Rising outside markets can initially offset the negative impacts of SLR on property
    values and beach width. Rising outside markets lead to higher income owners moving
    in, driving out investors and lower-income renters, increasing nourishment and
    beach width.
  7: SLR and decline in outside markets can lead to sharp declines in property values
    and increases in risk, despite beach nourishment efforts. Eventually, higher-income
    owners leave, investors buy the real estate, and rent it to lower-income occupants.
    Demographic shift can be thought of as a form of coastal gentrification.
  10: The model endogenizes individual pieces of the user cost of housing equation
    and allows for simulation of coastal housing markets confronting climate change.
    It simulates the effects of beach nourishment on property values and how the front
    row pays a higher share of costs.
  11: Property values and rents are influenced by both individual preferences for
    coastal amenities (beach width) and the expected impacts of climate change through
    a risk premium.
  12: 'Demographic changes, represented by updating agent parameter distributions,
    are an important driver in real estate markets; External market prices serve as
    benchmarks for owning coastal property; There are two possible feedbacks in the
    coastal market due to the external market: arbitrage and herding; The model includes
    risk of oceanfront property, episodic nature of storms, and property elevation
    relative to sea level.'
  13: Nourishment decisions are made by comparing the property tax burden against
    the increase in property value. A nourishment plan is implemented if at least
    50% of resident-owner agents vote to nourish.
  15: The page highlights studies on the tradeoffs between beach nourishment and managed
    retreat, the impact of repetitive flooding on outmigration and climate gentrification,
    and the effect of adaptation infrastructure on property values.
Methodology:
  1: The Coastal Home Ownership Model (C-HOM) incorporates changing physical attributes
    of the coast, economic values of these attributes, and dynamic risks associated
    with storms and flooding. Resident owners, renters, and non-resident investors
    jointly determine coastal property values and the policy choices that influence
    the physical evolution of the coast.
  3: "Coastal Home Ownership Model (C-HOM); 150-year time horizon; 50 years without\
    \ SLR as an initial period; evaluate large, long-term effects of SLR and a changing\
    \ storm climate (over the subsequent 100 years); model considers exogenous forces\
    \ that in\uFB02uence internal dynamics, including SLR, storm risk, and the in\uFB02\
    uence of competing property markets"
  4: The analysis is performed using a baseline model scenario simulating property
    and investor behavior with the onset of sea level rise at year 50.
  5: Numerical experiment involving model simulations comparing a baseline scenario
    with a scenario where the nourishment subsidy rate is cut to 50% at the onset
    of SLR (t=50).
  6: Numerical experiment/model simulation comparing a baseline model to scenarios
    with appreciating outside markets and SLR. Comparison of worlds with rising vs
    constant outside markets and presence vs absence of SLR. Results are differences
    between the baseline and the scenario, starting with SLR onset at t=50.
  7: Model simulations (C-HOM) coupling coastal real estate markets to the physical
    environment and exogenous climate forcing, and real estate markets in other locations.
    Includes beach erosion dynamics, local public finance decisions, parameterization
    of storm risk, and SLR effects on real estate and demographic changes.
  10: Agent-based model (C-HOM) simulating a coastal property market with owner agents,
    an investor agent, and a fixed number of properties. The model determines equilibrium
    price and investor market share based on market clearing conditions. The model
    considers beach management and nourishment and spatial resolution is at the nourishment
    unit level.
  11: The analysis uses a user cost framework for property valuation. It models agent
    preferences and investor behavior to simulate housing market dynamics under climate
    change. The model appears to simulate yearly changes.
  12: Agent-based model where agents adjust their parameters (income, willingness
    to pay) based on comparisons between coastal property values and external market
    values (POFe and PNOFe); Agent adjustment equation (Equation 18) with positive
    (herding) and negative (arbitrage) feedback mechanisms (Equations 19); Beta distributions
    are used to draw agent parameters; The upper limits of willingness to pay and
    scaling parameters adjust based on property price differences between the local
    community and the outside market (Equations 20 and 21).
  13: Agent-based model simulating property value changes due to beach nourishment
    decisions. Agents vote on nourishment plans based on a comparison of property
    tax burden and property value increase. Model simulates property value via user
    cost model, accounts for beach width and property tax, and is run in Matlab R2022b.
  15: Includes dynamic programming, hedonic pricing models, coupled physical and economic
    models, agent-based modeling, and integrated economic-geological models. Methodologies
    apply to coastal real estate, beach nourishment projects, shoreline management,
    and managed retreat strategies.
More Notes:
  1: The paper identifies a policy tradeoff between slowing demographic transitions
    in coastal communities and allowing property markets to adjust smoothly to risks
    from climate change.
  3: The model considers a coupled system with feedbacks between agent actions and
    the physical system; the human system affects the natural system, and vice versa.
  5: The baseline scenario shows that property values do not immediately reflect SLR
    risks but are obscured by risk, investment, and income interactions.
  6: The paper models the impact of subsidies on nourishment, and finds that rising
    outside markets can offset the effects of subsidy removal in the long run. Declining
    outside markets can reverse the influx of high-income agents.
  10: The model assumes a fixed supply of housing and abstracts away from short-term
    vacation rentals. It also assumes that when structures are destroyed by storms,
    they are typically rebuilt.
  11: The model incorporates heterogeneous agents with varying income, climate beliefs,
    and risk tolerance. It distinguishes between oceanfront and non-oceanfront properties.
    The risk premium appears to be based on the sum of the risk from storms and the
    risk from SLR with no consideration of the possible correlation between these
    variables.
  12: The model assumes a fixed risk of oceanfront property; Agents form heterogeneous
    expectations of capital gains based on past market returns.
  13: Institutional investors are taxed if nourishment is approved but do not vote.
    The model does not explicitly model dune building. Foresight about future climate
    change is captured in the risk parameters.
  15: The C-HOM (Coastal Home Ownership Model) is listed as a GitHub repository.

Quantitative material:
  1: The paper analyzes the long-term evolution of coastal real estate markets using
    the Coastal Home Ownership Model (C-HOM).
  3: 'One meter of SLR over a 100-year period; four model scenarios explore how internal
    and external dynamics affect the coupled coastal system (Fig. 2). Model parameters
    are in Supplementary Table S1.  Baseline scenario: 90% of beach nourishment costs
    are subsidized; nationwide housing markets are not appreciating. Second scenario:
    beach nourishment subsidy is reduced to 50%, outside markets remain constant.
    Third scenario: nourishment subsidy is returned to 90%, but outside markets appreciate
    after 50 years, such that real inland housing prices double over the next 50 years
    and then remain at that level over the last 50 years of the simulation. Final
    scenario: Nourishment is subsidized at 90%; outside property markets remain constant
    50 years after the onset of SLR, but outside values depreciate over the subsequent
    50-year period, declining to 10% of their initial value by the end of the simulation.'
  4: Property values and expected return rates change with sea level rise, but specific
    GDP effects or inflation impacts are not provided.
  5: A cut in the nourishment subsidy to 50% leads to a precipitous decline in property
    values after several decades (Fig. 4a). Reduction in nourishment subsidy leads
    to immediate decline in mean beach width (Fig. 4b).
  6: Figure 5 shows percent difference in property value, difference in beach width
    (meters), difference in income tax rate, and difference in investor market share
    over time, starting at t=50, with SLR. It depicts outcomes for oceanfront and
    non-oceanfront properties.
  7: Model simulations show property values plummeting sharply, risk premium increasing
    as SLR begins in t=50 and outside markets decline to 10% of initial levels over
    50 years; figures show predicted percentage changes.
  10: The model uses equations to calculate capitalization rates, user cost of housing,
    and willingness to pay for coastal amenities, allowing for quantitative analysis
    of how these factors influence property values.
  11: "The paper formulates state equations for beach width (Equation 8) and mean\
    \ sea level (MSL) (Equation 9). Willingness to pay (WTP) is modeled quantitatively\
    \ (Equation 10) as a function of base WTP and beach width, influenced by parameters\
    \ \u03B1 and \u03B2. The risk premium is quantified in Equation 12, accounting\
    \ for background risk and climate risks."
  12: Parameterization of risk from SLR (rSLt) as a function of property elevation;
    Parameterization of storm risk (rSt) based on storm return interval.
  13: Equations are presented for calculating the cost of nourishment (Eq. 22), the
    total cost of nourishment options (Eq. 23), the yearly loan repayment for nourishment
    (Eq. 24), and the additional property tax rate (Eq. 25).
  15: No specific quantitative estimates are provided on this page, but several papers
    use quantitative modeling (e.g., hedonic pricing models, coupled physical-economic
    models) to analyze the impact of risks and adaptation measures.
