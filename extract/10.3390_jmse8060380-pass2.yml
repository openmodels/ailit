Drivers of Risk:
  1: Sea level rise, climate change impacts, frequency and intensity of storms.
  2: Changes to coastal erosion and the increase in sea level rise projected under
    different RCP scenarios.
  10: Sea level rise, sediment budget deficit (leading to coastal erosion).
  13: Sea level rise associated with different RCP scenarios and environmental changes
    impacting coastal areas.
  14: Sea Level Rise (SLR) under different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs).
  15: Sea level rise due to anthropogenic climate change; Different Representative
    Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios (specifically RCP2.6 and RCP8.5).
  16: Sea level rise
Highlights:
  1: There is a significant step-up in expected costs of implementing coastal protection
    between RCP2.6 and RCP8.5.
  2: Local and state governments implemented a protection strategy through coastal
    protection projects in the Gold Coast, and NPV analyses for future scenarios were
    conducted.
  10: Sand volume loss impacts shoreline recession, which can be related to sea level
    rise equivalents.
  13: NPV costs of coastal protection increase significantly with higher RCP scenarios,
    indicating growing economic burden with increased sea level rise.
  14: The study estimates the costs associated with coastal protection strategies
    for climate change adaptation in a specific urban location, linking these costs
    to different SLR scenarios. The costs vary significantly depending on the RCP
    scenario.
  15: Significant step-up in expected costs of coastal defenses between RCP2.6 and
    RCP8.5; defensive actions will never approach replacement cost damages
  16: Coastal adaptation costs are predicted to stretch local government revenue-raising
    abilities, despite modest estimated costs.
Methodology:
  1: Historical data on coastal protection works on the Gold Coast (1964-1999) is
    compiled into a database, shoreline changes are analyzed using the Bruun model
    to determine implied sea level rise, and an economic model updates project costs
    based on projected sea level rise timing.
  2: The Bruun model is used to predict changes in shoreline positions, and an economic
    model updates project costs and calculates NPV based on projected sea level rise
    timing.
  10: Uses a formula (Equation 1) from the Queensland Department of Environment and
    Heritage Protection to relate sand loss to recession rate (R = Qe(h1 + 0.5h2)).
    Uses the Bruun model (Equation 2) to convert shoreline recession into a sea level
    rise equivalent.
  13: Economic modeling based on historical project timelines, costs, and projected
    sea level rise for RCP scenarios; results applicable through 2100.
  14: Estimation of costs to implement a coastal protection strategy (seawalls, groynes,
    beach nourishment) for different IPCC RCPs at a specific urban location (southern
    Gold Coast). Assumes distributed, reactive, and adaptive decision-making, where
    decisions are made when threats become apparent at a local scale. Assumes future
    decision-making for coastal protection will align with past decisions.
  15: Implicit cost-benefit analysis of historical defensive actions; NPV calculation
    of defensive costs.
  16: Analysis assumes a consistent beach profile for the 13 km of shoreline from
    Snapper rocks to Burleigh headland.
More Notes:
  1: The study uses experience from the Gold Coast to inform the costs and selection
    of adaptation strategies at the coastal settlement scale.
  10: The study focuses on the Gold Coast beaches in Australia. It uses the Bruun
    model, a widely used but simplified method for predicting beach shoreline response
    to sea level rise, acknowledging it operates 'in isolation of other factors'.
  13: Sensitivity analysis conducted with different discount rates (1% and 7.5%).
  14: The study focuses on the costs of adaptation, not the benefits of avoided damage
    or damage costs. The analysis is representative of a specific location and decision-making
    process, limiting its generalizability.
  15: Authors do not advocate for ad hoc, reactive adaptation. CBA can provide a false
    sense of certainty for something that is inherently deeply uncertain.
  16: Australian local government areas have favourable asset-to-liability ratios
    and low levels of debt, and can potentially borrow against a robust revenue base
    (rate payers and businesses) to finance adaptation.

  5: This page primarily discusses the methodology of using historical analogies to
    forecast responses to climate change, particularly shoreline change. It does not
    present any specific macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes, costs, or benefits
    of adaptation at a national level. The focus is on the process of learning from
    past societal responses rather than quantifying economic impacts or policy implications.

  1: Net present value (NPV) for implementing a coastal protection strategy, per km,
    of sandy beach shoreline.

    strategy per km of sandy beach shoreline against each of the IPCC's four representative
    concentration pathways (RCP) to 2100.

Quantitative material:
  1: Coastal protection costs between RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 increase from $573,792/km
    to $1.7 million/km with a 3% social discount rate; this step-up is by a factor
    of more than 6 at a social discount rate of 1%.
  2: NPV calculated for protection strategies per km of shoreline for different RCP
    scenarios up to 2100.
  10: 'Provides total cumulative sand volume lost from Gold Coast beaches between
    1962 and 2000 in five-year periods (Table 2). Example: 1962-1965: 153,000 m3'
  13: 'NPV of defensive sea level rise approach per kilometer: $574,000/km for RCP
    2.6 and $1.715 million/km for RCP 8.5, using a 3% discount rate.'
  14: 'Table 8 provides quantitative estimates of the costs of coastal protection
    between 2020 and 2100 (2016 USD) under different RCP scenarios (2.6, 4.5, 6, 8.5)
    with corresponding SLR values. Discount rate (r) = 7.5%; inflation = 1.7%. Examples:
    RCP 2.6, SLR 0.615m, Total Future Value = $25,027,000, NPV = $713,000, FV/km =
    $1,1925,000, NPV/km = $55,000. RCP 8.5, SLR 1.120m, Total Future Value = $316,189,000,
    NPV = $502,000, FV/km = $24,322,000, NPV/km = $39,000.'
  15: Expected cost of coastal defenses increases from $574,000/km to $1.7 million/km
    (r=3%) between RCP2.6 and RCP8.5; Increase is by a factor of more than 6 at a
    social discount rate (r=1%); Defensive costs for a 200m stretch of coastal development
    in Kirra has an NPV of AUD 3562 which defends private property to the current
    value of approaching AUD 50 million.

    Snapper rocks to Burleigh headland.
