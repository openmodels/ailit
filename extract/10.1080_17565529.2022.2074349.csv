1,Wage inequality,South Africa,"SSP2, RCPs",2050,No CC,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Page 3,"Climate change decreases the relative availability of female low-skilled labour, which causes the relative wages of low-skilled female labour to increase, closing the wage gap between male and female low-skilled labour as well as the wage gap between low-skilled and high-skilled female labour. Relative gains from closing the gender pay gap are likely to be compensated by the overall negative impact of climate change on economic output. Estimated for 2050"
