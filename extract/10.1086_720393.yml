Drivers of Risk:
  1: Long-term climate change (Little Ice Age), temperature.
  2: Heat waves, storms, and other weather events becoming more frequent and extreme;
    temperature rise; long-term temperature changes.
  4: Cooler temperatures (Little Ice Age), adverse temperature change.
  5: Drivers include historical and modern changes in temperature and cyclone risk.
  7: Reduced levels of energy emitted by the sun and increases in volcanic activity
    are considered causes of the Little Ice Age.
  8: Temperature changes, particularly cooling, affecting agricultural productivity
    and living standards during the Little Ice Age.
  11: Changes in temperature (specifically, the Little Ice Age).
  12: Changes in mean temperature.
  14: Temperature changes
  15: Temperature changes affect city size and economic growth.
  18: Temperature (yearly mean, growing-season, and non-growing season) as affected
    by climate change (e.g., Little Ice Age)
  19: Temperature changes impact yield ratios and wheat prices.
  21: Temperature changes (both year-to-year and agricultural year aggregates)
  22: Temperature changes, particularly during the growing season, impact crisis mortality.
  23: Agricultural year mean temperature, Growing-season temperature, Nongrowing-season
    temperature
  25: Little Ice Age (cooler temperatures), agricultural productivity, mortality,
    migration
  26: Temperature changes (specifically cooler temperatures during the Little Ice
    Age).
  31: Decrease in temperature (Little Ice Age).
  33: Mean temperature (averaged over 1500-1850), Trade Opportunities (high/low),
    Ruggedness of terrain (high/low).
  34: Temperature changes (Little Ice Age)
  35: Changes in temperature.
  36: Long-term temperature changes; Cooler temperatures of the Little Ice Age.
Highlights:
  1: Significant negative economic effects of long-term climate change; Economies
    adapted by increasing trade and changing land use.
  2: Understanding climate change entails understanding the effects of long-term temperature
    change and whether countries mitigate short-run effects through adaptation.
  4: Cooler temperatures increased mortality, trade volumes increased in response
    to cooler temperatures, cities participating in long-distance maritime trade were
    less affected by temperature change, cities with larger trade opportunities were
    less affected by temperature change.
  5: Economies dependent on agriculture with restricted trade access, particularly
    in developing countries, are particularly vulnerable to climate change.
  7: The Little Ice Age is presented as an example of how climate change can lead
    to decreases in agricultural productivity and social unrest.
  11: A positive relationship between temperature and city size is suggested, implying
    that a temperature decrease within a city is associated with decreases in city
    size.
  12: There is a positive correlation between changes in mean temperature and changes
    in city size.
  15: "A 1\xB0C decline in temperature correlates with a significant reduction in\
    \ city size and potential economic growth."
  18: Higher temperatures in a year are associated with higher yield ratios in the
    same year.
  19: Growing-season temperature strongly affects yield ratios and wheat prices.
  21: Temperature may affect mortality through its effect on agricultural productivity
    (lower temperatures decrease food production, leading to malnutrition).
  22: Warmer years followed by lower mortality; access to markets mitigated adverse
    temperature effects on crisis mortality.
  23: Increased temperature (agricultural year mean and growing-season) is associated
    with a statistically significant increase in the likelihood of a mortality crisis.
  25: The Little Ice Age decreased city size through its effect on agricultural productivity,
    mortality, and possibly migration; economies increased trade in response to the
    cooler temperatures of the Little Ice Age.
  26: "There is a negative relationship between the number of ships arriving at a\
    \ destination port and growing-season and nongrowing-season temperatures over\
    \ the past 5, 25, 50, and 100 years (cols. 1\u20134). This relationship is significant\
    \ at the 1% level for temperatures over the previous 25, 50, and 100 years."
  31: Trade can act as a buffer against the negative economic effects of temperature
    changes; Cities with more trading partners are less affected by temperature decreases.
  33: The effect of temperature on city size is moderated by trade opportunities and
    terrain ruggedness. Cities with large trade opportunities and low ruggedness are
    less negatively affected (or even benefit) from temperature decreases, while cities
    with large trade opportunities and high ruggedness are negatively affected by
    temperature decreases. Cities with low trade opportunities are also differentially
    impacted by temperature depending on ruggedness.
  34: The relationship between temperature change and land use is ambiguous; countries
    affected by the Little Ice Age may have expanded pasture and cropland to compensate
    for decreased agricultural productivity, or countries less affected may have expanded
    to benefit from high agricultural productivity and enter into trade relationships.
  35: The analysis suggests a positive relationship between temperature and both pasture
    and cropland area. For example, the coefficient on agricultural year mean temperature
    (years t-1 to t-100) is 2.38*** for Ln Total Pasture and 2.12*** for Ln Total
    Cropland.
  36: Access to trade appears as a key tool in overcoming the negative effects of
    long-term temperature changes; Agricultural sector is a channel through which
    temperature affects the economy; Agriculture-dependent economies with limited
    access to trade are particularly vulnerable to climate change.
Methodology:
  1: "Study of the economic effects of long-term and gradual climate change over 250\
    \ years in the Little Ice Age (1600\u20131850)."

More Notes:
  1: The study aims to understand the impact of today's climate change, especially
    in developing countries, based on historical evidence.
  2: IAMs are criticized for building assumptions on insufficient empirical evidence.
  4: The study focuses on the Little Ice Age in England and Europe. Adaptation strategies
    include trade and changes in land use. The analysis considers the role of inland
    trade opportunities and the impact of natural barriers on trade.
  5: The paper highlights adaptation challenges, including limited adaptation to climate
    change in US agriculture and energy efficiency, and notes that higher income reduces
    climate impacts.
  7: The text mentions witch hunts reappearing during the coolest periods of the Little
    Ice Age, suggesting a link between climate and social instability. The study relies
    on historical data and analysis of temperature variations and their correlation
    with societal changes.
  8: The text discusses historical adaptation measures, such as expanding agriculturally
    productive land or extending trade networks, to improve economic resilience.
  11: The study uses historical data to examine the impact of temperature changes
    on economic activity (city size). The applicability to modern climate change is
    discussed in the context of European agriculture potentially benefiting from small
    temperature increases due to its cold climate.
  12: The analysis controls for various factors including city characteristics and
    time trends. It's important to note that city size may not perfectly reflect macroeconomic
    outcomes at a national level. The temperature variable includes lagged values,
    over the past 100 and 50 years.
  14: The study controls for historical determinants of city size such as overseas
    trade, human capital accumulation, the spread of Protestantism, and legacies of
    the Roman Empire. The study focuses on Europe. There is a reference to another
    paper (Anderson, Johnson, and Koyama 2017) that uses historical panel temperature
    data.
  18: The analysis aims to test whether the Little Ice Age affected agricultural productivity.
  21: Mortality data is derived from English parish registers.
  23: The analysis distinguishes between parishes close to and far from markets, and
    considers the impact of temperature over both single years and five-year averages.
  25: The analysis of migrant marriages is based on limited data (seven English parishes)
    and the results are not statistically significant.
  26: The study uses Sound Toll data to examine the impact of temperature on trade
    volume.
  31: The study acknowledges that membership in trade organizations like the Hanseatic
    League is not random and may be correlated with other factors that contribute
    to resilience.
  33: The study uses historical data (1500-1850) and city-level analysis, which may
    limit its direct applicability to contemporary national-level macroeconomic and
    fiscal risk assessment of climate change. However, the finding that geographic
    factors (ruggedness) and trade opportunities moderate the economic impacts of
    temperature changes could be relevant for understanding regional vulnerabilities
    and adaptation strategies at a national level.
  34: The data on land use are estimates based on current-day and historical population,
    cropland, and pasture data, and the calculation depends on a number of assumptions
    that are hard to verify. Trade across country boundaries is not taken into account.
    Uncertainty in the data works against finding any patterns.
  35: The data is historical (1500-1850) and specific to European countries. This
    limits its direct applicability to current macroeconomic or macro-fiscal risk
    assessments of climate change adaptation.
  36: The study highlights the importance of trade in adapting to climate change and
    the vulnerability of agriculture-dependent economies with limited trade access.
    The findings are based on historical data and may have implications for developing
    countries.
