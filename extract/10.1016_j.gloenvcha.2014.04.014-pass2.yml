Drivers of Risk:
  4: The adaptation deficit is driven by a demand effect (increased demand for climate
    security with income) and an efficiency effect (spill-over externality on adaptation
    productivity).
  6: Climate-related natural disasters.
  7: Natural disasters.
  8: "Exogenous income (Y), Unit price of adaptation (\u03C0), Efficiency parameter\
    \ (\u03C6) which reflects total factor productivity"
  9: Income (through income effect on demand for climate security), Production efficiency
    (through efficiency effect on supply of climate security).
  11: The unmitigated physical impact of an event (I), which is a function of the
    intensity/magnitude of the event and the sensitivity/exposure of society.
  12: Intensity of tropical cyclones (cubed power of top wind speed); Local precipitation
    (for floods); Population (for disaster deaths); GDP (for economic damages); Land
    area; Disaster propensity.
  14: Higher income inequality and lower quality political institutions are associated
    with more disaster-related deaths.
  15: Political risk (Investment Profile, religious tension/interference, military
    influence, external conflict), government expenditure to GDP ratio, primary school
    enrollment rates, credit-to-GDP ratios.
  16: High credit availability, housing developments in vulnerable locations, and
    GDP per capita variations.
  17: Inequality (Gini coefficient), political risk, credit/GDP, life expectancy,
    trade openness.
  18: Exposure to flood events and tropical cyclones.
  20: Natural disaster events (specifically, flood events).
  21: Floods and tropical cyclones, Intensity of events (wind speed, rainfall, forward
    velocity, radius of maximum winds, local topography), Exposure (population, land
    mass)
  22: Climate disasters.
  23: Climate events; Economic diversification; Urbanization; Migration to coasts
  25: Natural disasters (floods, cyclones, earthquakes, extreme weather events), temperature
    changes, climate change
  28: Flood Magnitude, Population, Area (Km2), Time Trend, GDP per capita (GDPpc),
    Flood Propensity, Gini coefficient, Political risk, Government stability, Investment
    profile, Religiosity in politics, School enrolment (primary), Credit/GDP, Life
    Expectancy, Trade, Government expenditure
  29: Tropical cyclone magnitude, population, area, year (time trend), GDP per capita,
    cyclone propensity, Gini coefficient, political risk, investment profile, external
    conflict, military in politics, democracy, school enrolment (primary), credit/GDP,
    life expectancy, trade, and government expenditure.

Highlights:
  4: International efforts to close the adaptation deficit should focus on inclusive
    growth policies and dedicated adaptation support targeted at countries with high
    inefficiencies.
  7: The paper aims to identify countries that perform particularly well or badly,
    given their income level, in terms of disaster management. It presents a clear
    theoretical framework on the link between income and disaster loss.
  8: Demand for adaptation will increase with income, assuming climate security is
    not an inferior good
  9: An adaptation deficit can occur through an income effect and an efficiency effect,
    both potentially linked to income.
  14: Higher GDP per capita is associated with lower numbers of disaster deaths, while
    higher income inequality increases disaster fatalities.
  15: Disaster deaths are reduced in countries with better Investment Profiles and
    lower risk of religious tension/interference (floods), and lower risk of military
    influence and external conflict (tropical cyclones). A higher ratio of government
    expenditure to GDP reduces deaths from both floods and tropical cyclones. The
    relationship between primary school enrollment and disaster deaths is inconsistent.
    Higher credit-to-GDP ratios appear to be associated with an increased number of
    lives lost.
  16: Higher GDP per capita is associated with lower economic damages from climate-related
    disasters.
  17: Higher inequality (Gini coefficient) is associated with lower economic damages
    from floods, potentially due to a 'location effect' where poor people live in
    vulnerable areas but own fewer assets. Higher inequality is associated with higher
    economic losses from tropical cyclones. Better institutions (lower political risk)
    are associated with higher economic damages from tropical cyclones. Greater trade
    openness reduces losses from cyclone events.
  18: Northern European countries have high adaptive capacity for floods, while fragile
    states like Haiti and Zimbabwe rank low. The United States ranks below average
    for flood events, attributed to high income inequality and low government spending.
    Bangladesh performs well despite its poverty, possibly due to factors not captured
    by general government expenditure. Several sub-Saharan African countries perform
    surprisingly well.
  20: Efficiency variables lost significance in regressions with country fixed effects.
    Government spending remained significant in the regression for economic damages
    from flood events with country fixed effects. The identified efficiency effect
    is predominantly due to between-country (cross-sectional), rather than within-country
    differences.
  21: Disaster magnitude variables are highly significant predictors of disaster losses.
    Population and land mass are used as exogenous controls. Urbanization was found
    to be insignificant.
  22: Poor countries are more heavily affected by extreme weather events and hence
    future climate change than rich countries due to an 'adaptation deficit'.
  23: Closing the adaptation deficit requires a combination of general growth measures
    and dedicated assistance. Inclusive growth and strong institutions are preferred
    development models. Bangladesh, despite its disaster risk management, is identified
    as potentially needing adaptation assistance.
  25: Economic growth and rational decisions can make disaster losses grow faster
    than wealth; Temperatures and cyclones strongly associated with economic production
    in the Caribbean and Central America; Rising income may increase or decrease damage
    risk from natural disasters; Credit constraints magnify the impact of natural
    disasters on economic growth; Governance indicators affect disaster mortality
    prevention.
  28: Flood Magnitude, Population and GDPpc are highly significant drivers of flood
    deaths across all models. Increasing inequality (Gini coefficient) tends to increase
    deaths. Government Expenditure reduces deaths.
  29: Increased tropical cyclone magnitude and population size are associated with
    more deaths. Larger area is associated with fewer deaths. Higher GDP per capita
    and higher cyclone propensity are associated with fewer deaths. Higher income
    inequality (Gini coefficient) is associated with more deaths in some model specifications.
    Several variables related to efficiency and governance appear to influence cyclone
    deaths. Government expenditure is associated with fewer deaths.
  30: Flood Magnitude and Total GDP are consistently significant positive drivers
    of economic damages across all model specifications. Gini coefficient and Life
    Expectancy are consistently significant and negative drivers of economic damages.
  31: Cyclone Magnitude and Total GDP are consistently significant positive drivers
    of economic damages. Area is consistently a significant negative driver of economic
    damages. Several socioeconomic factors (Gini, Pol. risk, Socioec. Condition, Investment
    Profile, Ethnic Tensions, Credit/GDP, Trade) are significantly associated with
    economic damages, but their effects depend on the model specification.
Methodology:
  4: Uses panel data from the Munich Re natural catastrophe database to analyze the
    adaptation efficiency of countries in response to tropical cyclones and floods.
  6: Empirical analysis using data on climate-related natural disasters for a large
    number of countries between 1980 and 2008; uses the Munich Re natural catastrophe
    data.
  7: The paper establishes a theoretical framework on the link between income and
    disaster loss to construct country efficiency rankings in disaster management.
    It uses a model where adaptation to climate events is a consumption choice between
    climate security and other goods. It includes an empirical model to test these
    factors.
  8: Representative household utility maximization with a composite consumption good
    and climate security, alongside a profit maximization problem for climate security
    production, leading to demand and supply functions for adaptation
  9: The analysis equates adaptation supply and demand functions to derive an equilibrium
    relationship between climate security and income. Differentiation of the market
    equilibrium condition is used.
  11: OLS and negative binomial regressions are used to estimate the relationship
    between adaptation effort and observed damages, controlling for factors explaining
    the unmitigated physical impact of events.
  12: Uses explanatory variables to normalize the intensity of events and the exposure
    of countries to events; Includes controls for intensity of events (wind speed,
    precipitation), exposure (population, GDP, land area, time trend), demand effect
    (income, disaster propensity), and efficiency effect (institutional quality, income
    inequality, education, health, government expenditure, openness, financial sector
    development).
  13: The empirical results are based on four sets of regressions related to impact
    measures and hazard types, with different explanatory variables included based
    on the year of available data.
  14: Regression analysis using magnitude and population variables as predictors of
    disaster fatalities; significance considered for time trends, GDP per capita,
    income inequality, and the quality of political institutions.
  15: Regression analysis examining the relationship between various factors and disaster
    deaths. Applicable at a national level, considering cross-country differences.
  16: Economic damages assessed using log-log regression models with GDP per capita
    as a predictor.
  17: Regression analysis is used to assess the relationship between various socioeconomic
    and political factors and economic damages from floods and tropical cyclones.
    The applicability of the results is dependent on the validity of the regression
    model and the data used.
  18: Regression analysis to identify statistically significant predictors of the
    number of people killed for each disaster category. Efficiency index calculated
    as weighted sum of these predictors, with weights being the regression coefficients.
    Country averages taken over the sample period.
  19: The study uses both OLS regressions (for economic damages with a log-log specification)
    and negative binomial regressions (for the number of deaths) due to the over-dispersion
    of the disaster fatalities data.
  21: Regression analysis with controls for population, land mass, and a time trend;
    experiments with urbanization as a control. Focuses on floods and tropical cyclones.
  23: The paper identifies countries where efficiency spill-overs are weakest to suggest
    where adaptation assistance may be most needed. It controls for GDP or population
    size when assessing the link between economic growth and resilience to climate
    risk.
  25: Cross-sectional analysis, panel data analysis, stochastic frontier analysis,
    working papers with theoretical and empirical modeling.
  28: Negative binomial regression, clustered standard errors at the country level.
    Explanatory variables entered in logs and lagged one period (except Magnitude,
    Area and Gini).
  29: Negative binomial regression is used to model the number of deaths caused by
    tropical cyclones. The explanatory variables are entered in logs and lagged one
    period (except for Magnitude, Area, and Gini). Standard errors are clustered at
    the country level. Data covers 36-44 countries.
  30: 'Panel data regression with standard errors clustered at the country level.
    Explanatory variables (except Magnitude, Area and Gini) are lagged one period.
    Significance levels: * p<0.10, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01.'
  31: The analysis uses panel data and regression analysis to assess the economic
    damages from tropical cyclones. Standard errors are clustered at the country level.
    Explanatory variables (except Magnitude, Area and Gini) are lagged one period
    and entered in logs.
More Notes:
  7: The paper focuses on explaining the severity of disaster losses, not the effect
    of disasters on economic growth. It considers two channels (demand and supply-side
    efficiency) through which income affects climate security.
  8: The analysis focuses on the theoretical interaction between the cost of producing
    climate security and the utility people derive from it, setting up a framework
    for examining adaptation decisions. The striped images are not part of the analysis.
  9: The existence and sign of the efficiency effect cannot be determined a priori
    and must await empirical confirmation.
  11: The Munich Re database is used due to concerns about the reliability of economic
    damage estimates in other publicly available datasets, but acknowledges there
    is still likely to be greater measurement error in the damages series than for
    lives lost, even in this dataset.
  17: The paper suggests that economic losses suffered by poorer people may be undercounted
    in official figures. The paper also highlights the importance of understanding
    the relative adaptation efficiency of countries for policy purposes.
  18: Adaptive capacity for flood events is correlated with adaptive capacity for
    tropical cyclone events.
  19: The authors considered stochastic frontier analysis but found it less suitable
    for cross-country comparisons due to large variations in economic and social conditions
    and methodological challenges with the natural disaster data (lack of input cost
    data, large proportion of zeros in casualty data).
  20: Institutional quality, Gini coefficient, and GDP per capita show different patterns
    with and without country fixed effects.
  21: Other climate-related disasters (droughts, heat waves, wind storms) are not
    included due to data limitations. Earthquakes are excluded due to the focus on
    climate-related adaptation and their prominence in existing literature.
  22: The adaptation deficit is due to a demand effect (increased demand for climate
    security with income) and an efficiency effect (adaptation productivity enhanced
    in high-income economies due to spill-overs).
  23: The paper acknowledges methodological and data limitations. It also notes that
    the analysis only crudely accounts for the effect of income on the sensitivity
    of economies to climate events.
  28: The table explores the relationship between various normalization, demand, and
    efficiency factors and the number of deaths caused by flood events. The models
    differ in the inclusion of variables, and the number of observations and countries
    vary accordingly.
  29: The paper analyzes the impact of various economic and social factors on the
    number of deaths caused by tropical cyclones, treating these factors as related
    to normalisation, demand, and efficiency.
  30: The dependent variable 'Economic Damages' is likely logged given the note about
    explanatory variables being entered in logs. The term 'normalisation' is likely
    a reference to a standardisation of flood magnitude.
  31: The dependent variable is 'Economic Damages', but the units and definition of
    economic damages are not explicitly stated on the page. The analysis appears to
    control for 'normalisation', 'demand', and 'efficiency' related factors.
