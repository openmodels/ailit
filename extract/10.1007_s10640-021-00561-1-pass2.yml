Drivers of Risk:
  1: Externalities (both positive and negative) associated with adaptation and mitigation
    technologies are identified as drivers that can lead to deviations from socially
    optimum states.
  5: Externality effects (dj, fj) of adopting strategy A on the local environmental
    indicator of regions N and S.
  12: Public effects are negative (dN, dS, fS, fN > 0) - the nature of these is not
    specified on this page, but it implies that they reduce well-being.
  13: The non-adoption state (0, 0) and full adoption state (1, 1) may affect agents'
    well-being in regions N and S.
  14: Environmental dumping, adoption of environmental maladaptation technologies,
    exogenous factors like new policies that decrease domestic environmental effects
    in one region while raising foreign environmental effects in another, carbon taxes
    and stricter environmental regulation in more developed countries.
  20: Agents' self-interest and lack of altruism result in under-adoption or over-adoption
    of environmental adaptation technologies.
  21: Adoption or non-adoption of mitigation and maladaptation technologies; Externalities
    of technology adoption; Green policies that result in environmental dumping; Technological
    differences between regions

Highlights:
  1: Externalities can lead to over-adoption of maladaptive technologies and under-adoption
    of mitigation technologies. The paper also considers the potential for counterproductive
    effects of green policies and environmental dumping.
  5: Adoption of strategy A can have positive or negative externalities on environmental
    quality, leading to mitigation or maladaptation, respectively. The model describes
    how the share of agents adopting a technology changes based on the difference
    in well-being between adopting and not adopting.
  12: Multistability can occur, leading to different equilibria. Almost every trajectory
    leads to a vertex of Q, where each region ends up choosing a single strategy.
    The basins of attraction of the vertices are delimited by the stable manifolds
    of the saddle point in the interior of the sides of Q.
  13: Non-adoption can Pareto-dominate full adoption when the efficiency of strategy
    A is lower than local autonomous environmental quality.
  14: Shifting environmental burden from one country to another might worsen the well-being
    of all agents; A green tax or policy in a more developed region might decrease
    the domestic effect on the local resource but increase the foreign effect on the
    resource of another region, further degrading it; The overall well-being effects
    for agents in one region resulting from environmental policies in another region
    cannot be assessed a priori.
  20: Over-adoption of technology leads to lower well-being; under-adoption fails
    to reach Pareto-optimum due to lack of willingness to bear costs.
  21: Maladaptation technology can lead to over-adoption if agents don't internalize
    externalities, and mitigation technology can lead to under-adoption. Green policies
    aimed at reducing emissions in developed regions can negatively impact the well-being
    of both developed and less developed regions under certain conditions.
  24: Provides conditions for the stability of different stationary states (0,0),
    (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1) based on inequalities involving model parameters. The
    stability of each state depends on relationships between parameters N, S, p_N,
    p_S, E, e^C_N, e^C_S, d_N, d_S, f_N, and f_S.
Methodology:
  1: The paper employs a model with two regions at different stages of development
    to analyze the effects of externalities on the adoption of adaptation and mitigation
    technologies.
  5: The analysis uses a two-region (N and S) model with linear functions to describe
    the impact of cross-region adopters on the local environmental indicator. It employs
    replicator dynamics to model the change in the share of agents adopting a technology
    based on the payoff difference.
  12: 'Analysis of a two-region model (N and S) with agents choosing between two strategies:
    A (environmental adaptation) and NA (maladaptation). Mathematical formulation
    of average well-being in each region based on adoption rates (equations 15 and
    16). Attractor, repeller, and saddle point analysis of system dynamics.'
  13: Analysis involves stationary states and Pareto dominance in a dynamic system
    influenced by adoption scenarios in regions N and S.
  14: Comparative dynamics analysis based on payoff differentials to study the adoption
    dynamics of an environmental maladaptation technology; Modeling the shifting of
    environmental burden and its impact on well-being.
  20: Analysis considers two regions adopting environmental adaptation technologies
    with an emphasis on externalities and self-interest driving adoption.
  21: The analysis uses a model where agents in two regions (developed and less developed)
    make decisions about adopting mitigation or maladaptation technologies, considering
    the domestic and foreign public effects of their choices. It analyzes Pareto-optimality
    and potential for over- or under-adoption due to externalities.
  24: Stability analysis of stationary states (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1) using
    eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix derived from a system of equations. The stability
    depends on the parameters j, pj, Ej, eCj, d_j, f_j for j=N, S. Conditions for
    stability are given as inequalities involving these parameters.
More Notes:
  5: The model assumes that the public effects (dj, fj) are exogenously determined,
    and the analysis focuses on the dynamics of adoption rather than the specific
    technological or policy factors that influence these effects.
  20: Discusses differences between maladaptation and mitigation technologies and
    their respective externalities.
  21: The model does not incorporate all potential specifications, such as cases where
    domestic and foreign public effects have different signs. The analysis suggests
    further research could explore technological differences, the impact of shifting
    environmental burdens, and the relationship between regions at different stages
    of development.
  24: The page focuses on a mathematical model and its stability analysis. It doesn't
    explicitly link the variables or stability of these states to specific macroeconomic
    or fiscal variables or climate change adaptation at a national level. Without
    knowing the meaning of the parameters (x, z, N, S etc), it is hard to directly
    relate the results to the search criteria.
