Drivers of Risk:
  2: Convergence of changing climate conditions with the exposure and vulnerability
    of human and natural systems; specifically, changes in magnitude, intensity and/or
    frequency of relevant hazards, linked to Global Warming Levels (GWLs).
  4: Gradual climatic changes like sea level rise, the warming of sea surface temperatures
    (SSTs), the thawing of permafrost in Arctic coastal regions, the decrease in extent
    and thickness of sea ice, ocean acidification; Episodic extreme events like marine
    heatwaves, storm surges, and winds from tropical and extratropical cyclones; extreme
    events, like cyclones, floods, droughts or fires, extreme precipitation and heat
  5: Extreme heat; coastal flooding; storms; shifting climatologies; more frequent
    and intense extremes; El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability; warming
    trends in temperature; changes in precipitation patterns; extreme precipitation
    events; droughts; increase in overall precipitation variability; changes in expected
    average precipitation and its geographic patterns; compound extremes (e.g. concurrent
    heatwaves and droughts, pluvial flooding with coastal storm surge); slower, gradual
    changes in mean temperature and precipitation (and CO2 concentrations); water
    quality deterioration.
  14: Concurrent heatwaves and droughts, compound flooding events (sea level rise
    and storm surges), and specific meteorological conditions (heatwaves, temperature
    inversions, atmospheric stagnation) influenced by climate change contribute to
    risk.
  15: Hazards show direct relationship with global temperature changes, affecting
    climate risks.
Highlights:
  2: The paper offers a representation of the future evolution of hazard components
    of Representative Key Risks (RKRs), based on a systematic approach using existing
    literature and assessments.
  4: The categorization into eight RKRs of the many sectoral and regional risks is
    not mutually exclusive, i.e., the same risks may belong to more than one RKR.
  5: Climate change poses risks to critical physical infrastructure, living standards,
    human health, food security, and water security, with potential for cascading
    impacts and exacerbation of existing inequalities. The paper identifies specific
    hazards and vulnerabilities contributing to these risks.
  14: The page highlights the increasing frequency of compound extreme events due
    to climate change and the potential regional surface ozone penalties related to
    global warming.
  15: Every increment of global warming matters in increasing climate risks.
Methodology:
  2: Review and synthesis of existing literature and assessments to represent the
    future evolution of the hazard components of Representative Key Risks (RKRs);
    identification of relevant hazards for each RKR based upon IPCC WGII assessment;
    reporting on current state and expected future changes linked to GWLs.
  4: Authors started from a large set of key risks identified by the sectoral and
    regional chapters of the report, and clustered them into eight broad categories,
    the Representative Key Risks (RKRs).
  14: The analysis is focused on the hazard component, cataloging climatic impact-drivers
    (CIDs) that can become hazards influencing the severity of representative key
    risks (RKRs).
  15: Adopted a global perspective on changing climatic impact-drivers; assessment
    is based on global warming levels rather than specific emission scenarios.
More Notes:
  2: This paper focuses on the physical climate perspective and the hazard components
    of RKRs, setting the stage for other papers that treat the RKRs holistically.
  4: No relevant information
  15: Emphasizes that hazards are only one component of climate risks, with exposure
    and vulnerability also playing important roles.
