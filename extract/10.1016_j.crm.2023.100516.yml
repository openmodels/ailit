Drivers of Risk:
  1: No relevant information
  5: Identifies shocks such as extreme heat, cold temperatures, inland flooding, tropical
    storms, and sea level rise as impacting infrastructure and resources.
  6: Changes in average precipitation patterns, extreme precipitation events causing
    flooding, severe droughts, changes in snow cover, mass loss of glaciers, sea level
    rise.
  7: Lists climatic impact-drivers/potential hazards, organized by CID type (as in
    Ranasinghe et al. (2021) and Ruane et al. (2022)), as drivers contributing to
    key risks.
  8: CID/hazards
  9: global average SSTs warming
  10: GSAT warming is a driver of risk for heat extremes, cold extremes, mean precipitation,
    and heavy precipitation.
  11: Antiipated increases in inland flooding, drought, fire weather, enhanced precipitation
    variability related to ENSO, intensified tropical cyclones, and shifts in extra-tropical
    storm patterns.
  12: "The primary drivers of risk discussed are global warming levels, specifically\
    \ the discrete levels of 1.5\xB0C to 5\xB0C, impacting phenomena like Arctic warming,\
    \ sea level rise, permafrost volume, glacier mass, and the frequency of heatwaves."
  13: Global warming levels (GWLs) drive changes in sea ice extent, glacier mass,
    and sea level rise. Increased CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere drive ocean
    acidification. Relative sea level rise compounds storm surges and coastal flooding.
    Warming affects marine heatwave frequency and intensity.
  14: Storm surges enhanced by relative sea level rise; global warming levels (GWL);
    heatwaves and droughts; compound flooding events
  15: Patterns of regional warming and mean precipitation change, sea surface temperature
    warming, snow cover, permafrost thawing, heat extremes, tropical cyclone intensity,
    marine heatwaves, droughts and fire weather, storm surges (resulting from winds
    and sea level rise), sea level rise, and glacier mass loss.
  18: Extreme sea levels at different global warming levels are addressed in Tebaldi
    et al. (2021c).

Highlights:
  1: The hazard components of representative key risks
  5: Risks to various sectors include damage to infrastructure, exacerbation of poverty
    and inequality, threats to livelihoods, increased mortality and morbidity, and
    breakdown of food and water security.
  6: Increased frequency of extreme events may exacerbate conditions leading to conflict.
    Sea level rise can add to stress on a population that could find its territory
    permanently submerged or frequently flooded.
  7: Lists climatic impact-drivers/potential hazards and their relevance to various
    RKRs.
  8: The table summarizes the expected behavior of climate impact drivers (CID) or
    hazards as a function of global surface air temperature (GSAT) warming. The table
    indicates whether there is a quantitative relation (pink), a direct qualitative
    relation (yellow), or no robust relation (blue). Confidence levels from IPCC AR6
    WGI are included when available.
  9: "Global average SSTs will increase between 2 \u25E6C and 4 \u25E6C under High\
    \ warming (SSP5-8.5) and between 0.4 \u25E6C and 1.5 \u25E6C under Low warming\
    \ (SSP1-2.6) by 2081-2100."
  10: Future warming will be accompanied by increases in precipitation intensity,
    including precipitation associated to tropical cyclones.
  11: Fire weather is expected to become more severe with GSAT warming; ENSO-related
    precipitation variability is expected to increase under intermediate emission
    scenarios; tropical cyclone rain intensity and intensity distribution are expected
    to increase with higher GWLs.
  12: Key outcomes include projected losses in permafrost volume and snow cover, significant
    increase in marine heatwaves frequency, and warming intensification across different
    warming scenarios.
  13: "Even strongly limited warming (1.5 \u25E6C) will result in the historical 100-yr\
    \ coastal flooding event becoming an annual event in many locations by 2100. Glacier\
    \ mass loss is accelerating and will continue even without further warming. Arctic\
    \ sea ice will likely be ice-free in summer before 2050 under higher warming levels.\
    \ Ocean acidification is ongoing, and surface pH is currently at its lowest level\
    \ in at least the last 26,000 years."
  14: Higher frequencies of concurrent heatwaves and droughts, and of compound (sea
    level rise and storm-driven) flooding events are expected with additional warming.
  15: Many of the hazards considered can be put in a direct, strong relationship with
    global temperature changes. Sea level rise and glacier mass loss are in strong
    relation to warming, but present a lagged response.
Methodology:
  1: Physical climate perspective
  6: "Analysis is based on Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) experiments\
    \ run under a representative range of uncertain future anthropogenic radiative\
    \ forcing scenarios. Uses Global Surface Air Temperature (GSAT) warming with respect\
    \ to the pre-industrial baseline of 1850\u20131900 to define global warming levels\
    \ (GWLs). Pattern scaling used to represent the scaling of mean temperature and\
    \ precipitation with GWLs."
  7: "Relevance is based on the WG II authors\u2019 assessment of \u201Ckey\u201D\
    \ risks; if the WG II assessment did not identify hazards as drivers contributing\
    \ to \u201Ckey\u201D risks, or chose to assess them as relevant to one of the\
    \ RKRs explicitly but not to another, the corresponding cells are left blank."
  9: "Focuses on 2081\u20132100 outcomes"
  10: Pattern scaling can fairly accurately represent the scaling of mean precipitation
    with GSAT.
  12: The analysis determines future changes through a quantitative relationship with
    global surface air temperature (GSAT) warming, with projections made for discrete
    global warming levels (GWLs).
  13: The analysis relies on projections and assessments from various studies (e.g.,
    AR6 WGI), with time horizons extending to 2100.
  14: The frequency with which a 100-year storm surge becomes an annual event is assessed,
    assuming storm surges are enhanced by the amount of relative sea level rise experienced
    at a location by 2100, if global temperature reaches a certain GWL by that date.
  15: The analysis examines how climate impact-drivers (CIDs)/hazards are expected
    to evolve as a function of global warming levels (GWLs).
  18: The research includes climate model projections from CMIP6 ScenarioMIP, as noted
    in Tebaldi et al. (2021b).

    when heat extremes are defined as exceedances of thresholds.
  13: "The paper emphasizes the dependence of SLR on global warming levels and specific\
    \ time periods, acknowledging deep uncertainty in ice sheet behavior for warming\
    \ levels exceeding 2 \u25E6C. There is no discernible trend in the effects of\
    \ warming on large scale air pollution."
  14: The paper focuses on the hazard component of risk, acknowledging that exposure,
    vulnerability, and adaptation/mitigation responses also contribute to the ultimate
    outcome.
  15: The paper acknowledges that changes in exposure and vulnerability alongside
    climatic conditions are needed for realistic risk assessment.
  18: Anthropogenic heating of urban environments and feedback dynamics studied by
    Vahmani et al. (2022) may relate to climate impacts.

  9: "Global average SSTs will increase between 2 \u25E6C and 4 \u25E6C under High\
    \ warming (SSP5-8.5, reaching GWLS between 3.6 \u25E6C and 6.9 \u25E6C); but only\
    \ between 0.4 \u25E6C and 1.5 \u25E6C under Low warming (SSP1-2.6, reaching GWLs\
    \ between 1.3 \u25E6C and 2.8 \u25E6C) (see Fig. 2a)."
  10: "10-yr heat events are already 3 times more frequent than during pre-industrial\
    \ conditions, becoming about 4, 6 and 9 times more frequent for 1.5 \u25E6C, 2\
    \ \u25E6C and 4 \u25E6C respectively."
  11: "Probability of drought conditions measured by SPEI increases from 9.4% to 60%\
    \ with warming from 1\xB0C to 4\xB0C; frequency of 10-yr drought events increases\
    \ with GSAT warming, becoming 4 times more frequent at 4\xB0C."
  12: Quantitative information includes specific expected changes in snow cover (linear
    decrease of about 8% per degree of warming), permafrost volume (25% decrease per
    degree of warming), and the frequency of climate events as multiples of pre-industrial
    baselines.
  13: "Warming of 1.5 \u25E6C\u20132 \u25E6C would allow only 50\u201360 % of glacier\
    \ mass to remain. Warming of 2 \u25E6C\u20133 \u25E6C could allow 40\u201350 %\
    \ of glacier mass to remain, while higher warming would only see 25 %\u201340\
    \ % of glaciers remaining. By 2100, SLR will likely be between 0.15 and 0.30 m\
    \ until mid-century. By 2100 the outcome will depend on the scenario more strongly,\
    \ with a rise of 0.44 m (0.34\u20130.59) for a GWL of 1.5 \u25E6C; 0.51 m (0.40\u2013\
    0.69) for a GWL of 2 \u25E6C; 0.61 m (0.50\u20130.81) for a GWL of 3 \u25E6C;\
    \ 0.70 m (0.58\u20130.92) for a GWL of 4 \u25E6C; and 0.81 m (0.69\u20131.05)\
    \ for a GWL of 5 \u25E6C. For 5 \u25E6C of warming, ice sheet processes could\
    \ drive global mean sea level rise approaching 2 m. Marine heatwaves are projected\
    \ to become 2-to-9 times more frequent under SSP1-2.6 and between 3 and 15 times\
    \ more frequent under SSP5-8.5 by the end of the century."
  14: Surface ozone levels could decrease by 0.2 to 2 ppbv per degree of warming in
    low pollution regions; surface ozone levels could increase by 0.2 to 2 ppbv per
    degree of warming in high pollution regions.
