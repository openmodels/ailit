Drivers of Risk:
  1: Global climate change affecting water availability; Steady growth of water demand.
  2: Climate change impacts on water resources affecting irrigation, power generation
    and environmental flows in dry seasons; Projected population growth and rapid
    economic development placing great pressures on water resources; Unstable operation
    of thermal power plants constrained by water shortage; Increasing demand for water
    and energy.
  5: Climate change (specifically, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios), population growth,
    and industrial activity.
  8: Climate change impacts on water availability, increasing water demand (irrigation,
    domestic, energy), location of thermal power plants in water-stressed areas
Highlights:
  1: Water stress in the Ganges sub-basins, driven by climate change and increasing
    demand, poses a significant risk to energy security in India, particularly affecting
    thermal power generation in the Damodar, Gandak, and Yamuna sub-basins.
  2: Overall water availability in Chambal, Damodar, Gandak and Yamuna will increase
    in 2050; Total water demand will increase steadily ranging from 34% (in Damodar)
    to 42% (in Yamuna) in 2050; Many districts in Gandak and Yamuna will face severe
    level water deficit in 2050; Forty percent of the existing and planned thermal
    power plants in Damodar and almost all in Gandak and Yamuna are located in water-stressed
    areas which will face high water risks in the future.
  5: Water availability will increase in Damodar and Gandak sub-basins in both dry
    and wet seasons, particularly in Gandak in the wet season in the 2030s under RCP
    4.5 and in the 2050s under RCP 8.5. Water availability will decrease in Chambal
    in the dry season and Yamuna in both dry and wet seasons, particularly in the
    dry season in the 2050s under RCP 4.5 and in the wet season in the 2030s under
    RCP 8.5. Future water demand will increase due to population growth and industrial
    activity.
  8: Water stress in Gandak and Yamuna sub-basins poses a significant risk to the
    operation of existing and planned thermal power plants, endangering energy security;
    Chambal and Damodar have water surplus and are potentially suitable locations
    for new power plants.
Methodology:
  1: Integrated assessment of the water-energy nexus in the Ganges sub-basins focusing
    on water stress assessment for thermal power plants up to 2050 under climate change
    conditions using hydrological modeling under RCP 4.5.
  2: Hydrological modelling for water deficit in 2050.
  5: "Assessment of future water yield changes compared with the historical period\
    \ (1976\u20132005) under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 at different time periods (2020s,\
    \ 2030s and 2050s). Water demand assessment from five sectors and environmental\
    \ water requirements in the four sub-basins for the base period 2010 and future\
    \ periods (2030 and 2050)."
  8: Integrated approach combining hydrological model and water demand projections
    for major water users, power plant field surveys; spatial visualization of water
    supply, demand, gaps, and risks for thermal power plants at the district level;
    SWAT model used but limited calibration/validation
More Notes:
  1: The study suggests relocating planned installations from water-stressed areas
    and adopting less water-intensive power generation technologies.
  5: The four sub-basins are Chambal, Damodar, Gandak, and Yamuna, located within
    the Ganges basin in India. Stakeholder consultations were conducted to inform
    policymakers about the research and collect feedback.
  8: Suggests relocating planned installations from water-stressed areas to areas
    with water surplus, transitioning to more water-efficient energy generation, water
    conservation and efficient use, and water rights and trading systems.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Energy security in India is endangered due to water stress impacting thermal
    power generation.
  2: "Livelihoods of 85% of the population in the Ganges basin who rely on agriculture\
    \ are threatened by increasing pressures on water resources affected by climate\
    \ change, which will harm the basin\u2019s long-term sustainable development."

Quantitative material:
  1: Water availability in Chambal, Damodar, Gandak, and Yamuna sub-basins will increase
    by 13%, 33%, 21%, and 28%, respectively, in 2050 compared to 2010 under RCP 4.5.
    Yamuna will have 25% less water in the dry season in the 2050s. 30 out of 40 districts
    in Yamuna and 18 out of 33 districts in Gandak will face serious water deficit
    in 2050 under RCP 4.5. 40% of existing and planned thermal power plants in Damodar
    and almost all in Gandak and Yamuna will face high water risks in the future.
  2: Overall water availability in Chambal, Damodar, Gandak and Yamuna will increase
    by 13%, 33%, 21% and 28%, respectively, in 2050; Total water demand will increase
    steadily ranging from 34% (in Damodar) to 42% (in Yamuna) in 2050; 18 out of 33
    districts in Gandak and 30 out of 40 districts in Yamuna will face severe level
    water deficit in 2050; Approximately 8% of globally withdrawn water is used for
    energy generation; More than 50 GW installed capacity of thermal power generation
    systems in Ganges basin accounting for more than 40% of the total thermal power
    capacity in the region; 92% of the total installed capacity uses coal with the
    wet cooling system; 85% of the population in the Ganges basin relies on agriculture

    Gandak, and Yamuna sub-basins for different time periods (2020s, 2030s, and 2050s)

    in 2050
