Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increased incidence of extreme rain due to climate change, severe floods caused
    by heavy rain, and poorly drained surface water from long rain.
  3: Heavy rain (specifically, impacts on rice yield, quality and drainage). Climate
    factors such as temperature, solar radiation, and rainfall.
  4: Changes in temperature, solar radiation, and rainfall (including floods).
  6: Socioeconomic factors and climate conditions (unspecified changes)
  7: Heavy rain, specifically a long rain index representing ill-drained surface water
    (CRI) and a flood index (CFI)
  9: Heavy rain impacts rice productivity in Japan.
  11: Temperature and rainfall changes due to climate change impact rice TFP, with
    temperature increases being beneficial in northern Japan but harmful in southern
    Japan, while rainfall changes have always negative effects.
  12: Climate change impacts on rice crop-yield (CHI) and crop-quality (CQI).
Highlights:
  1: Heavy rain has a negative impact on rice TFP, with flooding and poor drainage
    reducing TFP by 2.5-4.5%. Future changes in rainfall are predicted to cause annual
    rice TFP to fluctuate, with rain's impact exceeding that of temperature due to
    variations in annual rainfall.
  3: Heavy rain, measured by indices for long rain and flooding, negatively impacts
    rice productivity.
  4: "High temperatures decrease rice yield after a threshold of approximately 20\xB0\
    C in July and August. High temperatures and insufficient solar radiation cause\
    \ rice quality to decline. A temperature of 19.34\xB0C showed the highest log\
    \ likelihood value. Positive influences dominate in northern Japan, but negative\
    \ influences are frequent in other prefectures under present circumstances."
  6: Northern regions (Hokkaido, Akita, Niigata) marked higher rice productivity than
    southern regions due to socioeconomic and climate differences. Rice TFPs of most
    regions increased from 1979 to 2010.
  7: Presents descriptive statistics for variables related to rice productivity and
    quality, along with climate variables (rain, solar radiation, temperature) and
    other factors (knowledge capital, population density). Shows rice TFP by regions.
  9: Northern prefectures initially experience positive effects of temperature on
    rice productivity but eventually shift to negative effects, while southern prefectures
    consistently show negative effects.
  11: Future temperature changes are beneficial for rice TFP in northern Japan but
    harmful in southern Japan. Rain negatively impacts rice TFP, leading to fluctuations
    greater than temperature impacts.
  12: Temperature variables (TM7, TM8, TM9, TM7^2, TM8^2, TM9^2) significantly affect
    crop-yield (Table A1). SR7, SR8 and ABS(TL78-19.34), DYR significantly affect
    crop-quality (Table A2).
Methodology:
  1: "Panel data regression analysis used to estimate causality functions. Rice TFP\
    \ measured using T\xF6rnqvist-Theil and Malmquist indexes. Climate projections\
    \ from global-climate model (GCM) used in conjunction with crop and hydrological\
    \ models to predict future TFP."
  3: Regression analysis is used to model the impact of climate factors (heavy rain,
    temperature, solar radiation, rainfall) and socioeconomic factors (farm management
    area, R&D investment, population density) on rice TFP. Data Envelopment Analysis
    (DEA) is used to estimate the M-index for technological gaps and initial TFP values.
  4: Crop-yield and crop-quality models are used to estimate the impact of climate
    factors on rice production. A hydrological model is used to quantify the impact
    of floods on rice during maturity and harvest stages. The crop-yield and crop-quality
    models were estimated by using the latest data. The parameters of the hydrological
    model are the same as Kudo et al. (2013).
  6: T-index and M-index calculation of rice TFP for each region of Japan from 1979
    to 2010; future values of MA were set until 2100, based on past MA trends in each
    region.
  7: Uses descriptive statistics of variables to estimate TFP and CQI functions.
  9: TFP elasticity is calculated with respect to explanatory climate impact variables
    across different regions in Japan over multiple time periods.
  11: Panel data analysis applying crop-yield, crop-quality, and hydrological models,
    using MIROC projection results to predict rice TFP under future climate scenarios.
  12: Panel data analysis with fixed-effect and random-effect models is used to estimate
    the impact of temperature and other variables on rice crop-yield and crop-quality.
    Hausman test is used to select the best model.
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on the impact of rain on rice productivity in Japan.
  3: The study uses a perpetual-inventory method to estimate R&D capital stocks. The
    study focuses on rice productivity in Japan.
  4: The study focuses on rice production in Japan. The hydrological model considers
    terrain mesh and outflow calculation, linking outflow to flood disasters.
  6: Nine prefectures were selected to represent different locations in Japan for
    the analysis. Eleven prefectures had correlation coefficients less than 0.7 for
    T-index and M-index (Ibaraki, among others).
  7: CHI* and CQI* are estimated using fixed-effect models, with actual climate conditions,
    but without the fixed-effect coefficients in the estimations, to eliminate latent
    effects.
  11: Both T-index and M-index provide stable predictions for rice TFP under climate
    change, though R&D capital stocks and population density show differences. Government
    support such as consolidating drainage systems is needed to counter negative rain
    impacts on rice production.
  12: The study focuses on agricultural mitigation and adaptation technologies for
    climate change, specifically rice production in Japan.

Quantitative material:
  1: Poorly drained surface water as well as flooding reduced rice TFP by 2.5 to 4.5%.
  3: The regression model includes variables like CHI (rice-yield index), CQI (rice-quality
    index), CRI (long-rain index), and CFI (flood index), but their actual values
    and the estimated coefficients are not provided on this page.
  4: "Equations are provided to estimate crop yield (CHIr,t) and crop quality (CQIr,t),\
    \ based on temperature (TM), solar radiation (SR), and rainfall. Threshold temperature\
    \ of approximately 20.0\xB0C in July and August. Temperature of 19.34\xB0C for\
    \ CQI. The long-rain index (CRI) is measured by the sum of rainfall during August\
    \ and September. CFI is measured as the total unit outflow per terrain mesh area\
    \ during the typhoon season in August and September."
  6: Correlation coefficients of T-index and M-index rice TFP exceeded 0.7 for 27
    prefectures.
  7: Provides descriptive statistics (average, standard deviation) for TFP (T-index
    and M-index), management area per farm household (MA), knowledge capital (nationwide
    and prefecture levels), rice yield per area (CHI and CHI*), percentage of 1st
    grade rice (CQI and CQI*), long rain index (CRI), flood index (CFI), solar radiation
    (SR7, SR8, SR9), maximum daily temperature (TM7, TM8, TM9), average minimum daily
    temperature (TL78), and population density (POP).
  9: Elasticity values for total factor productivity (TFP) are given with respect
    to temperature and rain via crop yield (CHI), crop quality (CQI), long rain index
    (CRI), and flood index (CFI).
  11: Long rain and flood decrease rice TFP by 2.5 to 4.5%; impacts of rain on TFP
    fluctuations exceed those of temperature despite lower elasticity, due to higher
    variation in annual rainfall.
