10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e41158,“Harnessing the power of soil microbes: Their dual impact in integrated nutrient management and mediating climate stress for sustainable rice crop production” A systematic review,"Sustainable agricultural practices are essential to meet food demands for the increased population while minimizing the environmental impact. Considering rice as staple food for most of the world's population, it requires innovative approaches to ensure sustainable production. In this paper, we create a hypothesis that integrated nutrient management (INM) acts as a source of energy for microbes and improves the physical, chemical and biological properties of soils, but the current understanding of how soil microbiomes interact in integrated nutrient management toward mediating climate stress to support sustainable rice crop production is limited. Hence, we develop literature search through Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) to explore the hidden knowledge related to that question. The outcomes of the study are postulated as a viable option to minimize excessive chemical fertilizers and promote organic-based nutrient management that directly impacts microbial consortia. This review uncovered that plant-microbe interactions and nutrient transformation depend heavily on soil microbes while the abundance, diversity, and activity of soil microbiome is enhanced more with integrated nutrient management than with sole synthetic fertilizers. Through their ability to enhance nutrient availability and uptake, improve soil structure, heavy metal detoxification, salinity and drought tolerance, and suppress pathogens, they can alleviate abiotic stress associated with climate change. Therefore, optimization of microbial communities serves as a potential mechanism for INM to enhance rice yield and mitigate climate stress. This would improve soil health and enhance the resilience of the rice plant to climate change. However, despite various benefits obtained through INM and microbes in paddy production systems, the literature indicated that adoption of this technology is limited to smallholder farmers due to lack of knowledge, unavailability of sufficient organic materials and poor understanding of the long-term impacts associated with over-application of chemical fertilizers. Therefore, scientists must translate several research discoveries related to sustainable agriculture into simple language that can be adopted by farmers and future research should be a farmers-participatory approach to generate awareness investments and knowledge of farmers in adopting sustainability measures. Additionally, research could focus on identifying mechanisms by which microbiomes improve nutrient uptake and rice growth and how these mechanisms can be optimized through integrated nutrient management strategies with regard to climate stresses. © 2024 The Author(s)","**Classification:** RP, XU  **Explanation:**  *   **RP:** The paper discusses how integrated nutrient management and soil microbes can mitigate climate stress in rice production, implicitly projecting potential direct impacts (e.g., reduced crop loss) under future climate change scenarios. *   **XU:** The abstract does not mention any specific location in the United States, and broadly discusses rice production globally.

This study employs numerical simulations to examine the impact of climate change on the deformation of Regina clay in Regina, Canada. A key innovation is the development of a coupled hydro-mechanical model that integrates a soil-atmosphere boundary to simulate moisture dynamics using a single stress state framework for unsaturated soils. This approach simplifies analysis by incorporating suction stress and aligns with classical soil mechanics principles, enhancing model accuracy and predictability. Climate projections from the latest CMIP6 data were utilized, incorporating 26 general circulation models (GCMs) and three shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). By using climate data from multiple GCMs and SSPs, the study captures a wide range of potential outcomes, increasing the reliability of predictions. A novel structured approach was applied to select critical future climate scenarios, enabling a comprehensive analysis of soil deformation under historical and future climatic conditions. Results indicate a shift from historical shrinkage behavior to swelling dominance in expansive soils, with the maximum yearly ground movement projected to be 59 mm in 2063, surpassing the historical peak of 44 mm in 1998. Ground movement (heave) is anticipated to exceed historical levels by more than 20%, despite future precipitation increases of less than 20%. The study highlights that ground deformation is influenced more by the timing and sequence of extreme precipitation events than by peak daily rainfall, particularly during colder months with minimal evaporation. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","XU, RP  This paper focuses on Regina, Canada, and therefore doesn't provide U.S.-specific information.

Our approach is to analyze multi-model ensemble-means from global numerical-simulations available through the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). A 250-year span consisting of the 1850–2014 historical period and the 2015–2099 climate-change projection was considered, where the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) 2.45 and 5.85 were selected as the projected climate-change scenarios. In the historical period, global linear trends show an SST increasing at 0.0024 °C year-1 and a CHL decreasing at −2.35x10-5 mg m-3 year-1, but by the last years (1985–2014) these changes become more abrupt: SST rising at 0.0146 °C year-1 and CHL declining at −1.49x10-4 mg m-3 year-1. During the intense climate-change scenario (SSP-5.85), SST increases at 0.0341 °C year-1 and CHL decreases at −0.0002 mg m-3 year-1, but in the last years (2070–2099) the warming is stronger (0.045 °C year-1) and the CHL decline is weaker (−0.0001 mg m-3 year-1). Additionally, Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) and dual Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) analyses on the model-data ensembles show: 1) significant correlations between SST and CHL patterns and climate teleconnection indices, 2) contracting polar and high latitude seascapes, 3) rising SST range (both high and low temperatures), 4) declining CHL in warming tropical seascapes, and 5) global expansion of low CHL levels. On the other hand, recent (2022–2023) global observed-SST anomalies mirror end-of-century projections, with extreme anomalies in tropical and subtropical regions and significant changes in near-polar regions.

10.1016/j.rser.2024.115073,The environmental factors affecting solar photovoltaic output,"The global expansion of solar photovoltaics (PV) is central to the global energy transition. As governments aim to triple renewable energy capacity by 2030, solar PV is poised for rapid growth, particularly outside mid-latitude regions (China, Europe, US) where uptake has been highest. These new growth areas have diverse environmental conditions, where factors like higher temperatures and aerosol concentrations strongly impact solar power production. A comprehensive review of these effects therefore aids PV performance and siting optimization. This review examines six key influences: solar irradiance, ambient temperature, atmospheric conditions, terrain effects, extreme weather events, and long-term irradiance changes. First, solar irradiance has strong geographic and temporal variability, making it the most significant factor. Second, raising module temperature reduces efficiency by 0.4–0.5 % per degree Celsius, limiting productivity in hotter climates. Third, atmospheric conditions (clouds, aerosols, pollutants, and dust) can reduce electricity output by up to 60 %, especially in desert regions. Fourth, terrain factors like albedo and snow present mixed effects, with increased reflection boosting output but snow obstructing panels. Fifth, extreme weather like wildfires and hailstorms cause substantial damage, while solar eclipses lead to large but short-lived output losses. Finally, long-term changes in solar irradiance, driven by climate change and air pollutants, present future challenges for maintaining PV efficiency. Optimizing PV systems for diverse climates and mitigating environmental impacts on productivity is important to the continued success of solar photovoltaics. This review highlights the need for tailored strategies to maintain performance in varied and evolving environmental contexts. © 2024 The Authors","Include.

10.1111/roiw.12719,Climate Shocks in the Anthropocene Era: Should Net Domestic Product Reflect Climate Disasters?,"The asset costs of natural disasters in the United States grew rapidly from 1980 to 2023, with the trend rising 4.9% annually in real terms to $90 billion in 2023. Much of this trend in asset losses is likely due to climate change, and implies a faster depreciation of real assets. We argue that the expected depreciation from these events should be included in consumption of fixed capital (CFC), leading to lower levels and slightly lower growth rates for net domestic product (NDP) and net domestic investment. We use Poisson pseudo-maximum-likelihood regressions to estimate this expectation and to generate our experimental measure of costs. An alternative calculation of CFC and NDP might directly include the time series of costs incurred rather than the far smoother expectation; this was the procedure adopted before 2009 and resulted in abrupt changes in NDP.

10.1016/j.dwt.2024.100889,Implications of climate change on freshwater ecosystems and their biodiversity,"Global warming is a phenomenon whereby the planet's exposure to the sun's radiation worsens from the high emission of gasses believed to trap heat within the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the leading greenhouse gas majorly responsible for global warming and other related issues and is a danger to global society. This one has a particular role in portraying the key importance of the shifting climate that invariably influences water supply and agricultural production. Global warming presents complex challenges to aquatic organisms and stocks and other natural aquatic life resources. This study examines how freshwater and marine species are affected by climate change in aquatic habitats. Aquatic species' metabolism, growth, reproduction, and dispersal are all impacted by rising temperatures and altered water chemistry brought on by increased greenhouse gas emissions, especially CO2. The goal is to pinpoint the ecosystems and vulnerable species that are most impacted by these changes and suggest flexible management techniques. The suggested remedies center on creating sustainable conservation strategies that lessen the effects of climate change on aquatic biodiversity and increase these ecosystems' resilience. The socio-economic interdependencies between water and climate change impact agricultural and water resources, and the pressures exerted on water bodies and water supply landscapes. Another area is related to alterations in the physical and chemical properties of the water, such as the temperature, which is a well-known effect of climate change: 'This causes abnormalities in the metabolism and physiology of aquatic species.' These alterations flow through the chain and regime of growth, reproduction, feeding habits and distribution, migration, and mass of fish and other creatures in the water system. However, the long-term effect of climate variation and climate change on freshwater ecosystems requires much scientific investigation to address challenges in aquatic ecosystem conservation and sustainability.

This study introduces “energy demand science” as a multidisciplinary field to address these challenges, focusing on the residential sector, which significantly impacts energy use due to occupant behavior and lifestyle. Using a comprehensive review of literature and advanced modeling techniques, this research explores mechanisms driving energy demand. Key results show that energy demand can be reduced by up to 40 % by 2050 through lifestyle adjustments, urbanization, and innovative technologies, aligning with global warming targets below 1.5 °C.

With ongoing global warming and intensifying human activities, water quality trends in lakes worldwide varied significantly, and the trend of algal blooms in the next few decades is unclear. However, there is a lack of comprehensive quantitative research on the future projection of lake algal blooms globally due to the scarcity of long-term algal blooms observational data and the complex nonlinear relationships between algal blooms and their driving factors. We aimed to develop a global projection model to evaluate the future trend in algal bloom occurrences in large lakes under various socio-economic development scenarios. We focused our research on 161 natural lakes worldwide, each exceeding 500 km2. The results indicated that the Random Forest model performed best (Overall Accuracy: 0.9697, Kappa: 0.8721) among various machine learning models which were applied in this study. The predicted results showed that, by the end of this century, the number of lakes experiencing algal blooms and the intensity of these blooms will worsen under higher forcing scenarios (SSP370 and SSP585) (p < 0.05). In different regions, lakes with increasing algal blooms are mainly distributed in Africa, Asia, and North America, while lakes with decreasing occurrence are primarily found in Europe. Additionally, underdeveloped regions, such as Africa, exhibit greater sensitivity to different SSP scenarios due to high variability in population and economic growth.

10.1016/j.wace.2024.100659,Characterization of temperature and humidity effects on extreme heat stress under global warming and urban growth in the Pearl and Yangtze River Deltas of China,"With global warming accelerating, the heavily populated and rapidly urbanized coastal regions of the Pearl River Delta (PRD) and the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) stand as representative areas with mounting concerns about extreme heat stress. This study analyzes differentiated effects of temperature (TAS) and relative humidity (RH) on human heat stress measured by wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) in those urban regions based on machine learning and mathematical derivation, while also examining the impacts of global warming and urbanization on prospective heat risks. To generate fine-scale climate projections targeted at the PRD and YRD, two global projections forced by Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario are dynamically downscaled using non-hydrostatic Regional Climate Model version 4.7 (RegCM4), with the urban density and extent updated every year based on Shared Socioeconomic Pathways 5-8.5 (SSP5) scenario, thereby incorporating the transient urban growth into future projections. The bias-corrected downscaled simulations effectively capture the distinct interdependencies between TAS and RH on WBGT across different regions, similar to the observed patterns during the historical period. While the absolute contribution of TAS to WBGT is larger than RH regardless of warming levels and regions, the relative increase in RH becomes more pronounced with warming. Under RCP8.5 scenario, unprecedentedly extreme WBGT is projected to emerge in the far future (2080–2099). In contrast, the effect of urbanization appears to be more dominant in the near future (2030–2049) as urban density under SSP5 scenario is projected to peak around the 2040s and gradually decrease afterwards. The reduction of RH is found in the intensely urbanized areas locally, but it does not significantly lower WBGT because the positive contribution of increased TAS is more dominant. As a result, highly urbanized regions still exhibit higher WBGT compared to other areas. In addition, urban heat island effect is more pronounced for compact areas with high urban density (i.e., PRD) and at night. Despite the smaller temperature increase from urban heat island effect compared to global warming, it can play a critical role in exacerbating heat stress, adding to the already dangerous humid and hot conditions. © 2024 The Authors","XU, RP  This paper focuses on the Pearl and Yangtze River Deltas of China, lacking U.S.-specific information (XU).

10.1016/j.agwat.2024.108683,Multivariate time series convolutional neural networks for long-term agricultural drought prediction under global warming,"Agricultural drought (AD) is disastrous to crop production and plant growth. The prediction of AD with sufficient lead time is helpful for developing agricultural water strategy, particularly under the context of global warming. However, the previous studies mainly focused on short lead times (1–6 months) and only used 3 or less variables to predict AD through copula models. In this study, a novel multivariate time series convolutional neural network (T-CNN) is developed to predict AD with long lead times based on multiple meteorological variables. To demonstrate its feasibility and novelty, T-CNN is used in the Aral Sea Basin (ASB) where agricultural production is dominant. Three global climate models (GCMs) and three shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) from CMIP6 are considered during 2026–2100. Results indicate that (1) precipitation, temperature, potential evapotranspiration, relative humidity and northward wind are significantly correlated with AD, and are selected as the predictors of AD; (2) compared with the conventional CNN and convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM), T-CNN's performance is better, taking only about 10% of the computation time of ConvLSTM; (3) T-CNN can effectively extract the spatiotemporal characteristics of meteorological predictors and reproduce AD, showing high correlation coefficients (R>0.9) for 92.5% of the grids across ASB; (4) the result of simple model averaging (SMA) is better than other GCMs, indicating that the spatial differences in AD would become more pronounced with increasing time and emission level; (5) compared with the historical period, under SSP585, the extreme drought would increase 0.20 months/year (2026–2050), 0.23 months/year (2051–2075) and 0.28 months/year (2076–2100).

Based on the mid-Pliocene simulations from the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2 and the historical simulations and shared socio-economic pathway 5–8.5 experiments from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6, the present study contrasts the Sahel summer rainfall changes between the past mid-Pliocene and near future global warming climates. The results show that the Western African summer monsoon (WASM) circulation, closely linked with the Sahel summer rainfall change, tends to strengthen in both the past and future global warming climates, but the monsoonal circulation strengthening is much more intense in the past warm period than in the projected warm future. This causes that the multi-model ensemble (MME) mean increase ratio of Sahel summer rainfall in the past warming climate is about twice to three times larger than that in the future warming climate for the same increase of global mean surface temperature (the regional rainfall increase ratio in the MME mean: about 19.6% per one degree Celsius of global warming in the mid-Pliocene simulations versus about 7.7% per one degree Celsius of global warming in the SSP5-8.5 future projections). Such a striking discrepancy in the regional circulation and hydrological cycle changes is mainly attributed to a dramatically stronger warming over the Canadian Archipelago and Greenland during the mid-Pliocene warm period relative to the projected near future. The more significant northern high-latitude warming during the mid-Pliocene enhances the meridional temperature gradient between the extratropical and tropical regions, which could induce an excessive northward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and a stronger WASM, and thus result in a more intense hydrological cycle around the Sahel region. Our results highlight that besides the global mean temperature increase, meridional warming patterns are also essential for the changes of WASM and regional hydrological cycle in a warmer world.

Our modern food system, based on open-environment production and globalised supply chains, is vulnerable to a litany of abiotic and biotic stressors exacerbated by anthropogenic climate change.

Current trajectories suggest global warming of 2.0–4.9 °C by 2100, however, a worst-case emissions scenario with rapid combustion of all available fossil fuels could cause a rise of 12 °C.

Using a panel data set of 174 countries over the years 1960 to 2014, we find that per-capita real output growth is adversely affected by persistent changes in the temperature above or below its historical norm, but we do not obtain any statistically significant effects for changes in precipitation. We also show that the marginal effects of temperature shocks vary across climates and income groups. Our counterfactual analysis suggests that a persistent increase in average global temperature by 0.04 °C per year, in the absence of mitigation policies, reduces world real GDP per capita by more than 7 percent by 2100. On the other hand, abiding by the Paris Agreement goals, thereby limiting the temperature increase to 0.01 °C per annum, reduces the loss substantially to about 1 percent. These effects vary significantly across countries depending on the pace of temperature increases and variability of climate conditions.

Temperature is an important environmental factor affecting almost all aspects of growth and development in plants. The grapevine (Vitis spp.) is quite sensitive to extreme temperatures. Over the current century, temperatures are projected to continue rising with negative impacts on viticulture. These consequences range from short-term effects on wine quality to long-term issues such as the suitability of certain varieties and the sustainability of viticulture in traditional wine regions. Many viticultural zones, particularly in Mediterranean climate regions, may not be suitable for growing winegrapes in the near future unless we develop heat-stress-adapted genotypes or identify and exploit stress-tolerant germplasm. Grapevines, like other plants, have developed strategies to maintain homeostasis and cope with high-temperature stress. These mechanisms include physiological adaptations and activation of signaling pathways and gene regulatory networks governing heat stress response and acquisition of thermotolerance. Here, we review the major impacts of global warming on grape phenology and viticulture and focus on the physiological and molecular responses of the grapevine to heat stress. © 2020 by the authors.

We do not find evidence for permanent growth rate impacts but we find robust evidence that temperature affects productivity levels considerably. An increase in global mean surface temperature by about 3.5°C until the end of the century would reduce global output by 7–14% in 2100, with even higher damages in tropical and poor regions.

Increasing extreme events are also considered to be a result of climate warming, and they may have widespread and diverse effects on health, agriculture, economics, and political conflicts. Still, the detection and quantification of climate change, both in observations and climate models, constitute a main focus of the scientific community. Here, we develop an approach based on network and percolation frameworks to study the impacts of climate changes in the past decades using historical models and reanalysis records, and we analyze the expected upcoming impacts using various future global warming scenarios. We find an abrupt transition during the evolution of the climate network, indicating a consistent poleward expansion of the largest cluster that corresponds to the tropical area, as well as the weakening of the strength of links in the tropic. This is found both in the reanalysis data and in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) 21st century climate change simulations.

A dynamic bio-economic model is built by employing a shrimp stock's growth function depending on Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and on mangrove surface. The model is empirically calibrated for the French Guiana shrimp fishery using time series collected over 1995–2011. First, two Cobb-Douglas functions, which describe shrimp's natural growth and harvest, are estimated. Then, a Maximum Economic Yield (MEY) harvest rule, based on the optimization of the net present value derived from fishing, is computed. Three management strategies are compared (Closure, Status Quo management, and MEY) under three mangrove surface fluctuations and climatic scenarios: (a) SST and mangrove remain stable, (b) SST rises while mangrove declines, (c) SST rises and mangrove remains stable. The scenarios considering a SST rise are based on the median greenhouse gases emission projections estimated by the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change).

10.1186/s13071-017-2071-2,How does the dengue vector mosquito Aedes albopictus respond to global warming?,"Background: Global warming has a marked influence on the life cycle of epidemic vectors as well as their interactions with human beings. The Aedes albopictus mosquito as the vector of dengue fever surged exponentially in the last decade, raising ecological and epistemological concerns of how climate change altered its growth rate and population dynamics. As the global warming pattern is considerably uneven across four seasons, with a confirmed stronger effect in winter, an emerging need arises as to exploring how the seasonal warming effects influence the annual development of Ae. albopictus. Methods: The model consolidates a 35-year climate dataset and designs fifteen warming patterns that increase the temperature of selected seasons. Based on a recently developed mechanistic population model of Ae. albopictus, the model simulates the thermal reaction of blood-fed adults by systematically increasing the temperature from 0.5 to 5 °C at an interval of 0.5 °C in each warming pattern. Results: The results show the warming effects are different across seasons. The warming effects in spring and winter facilitate the development of the species by shortening the diapause period. The warming effect in summer is primarily negative by inhibiting mosquito development. The warming effect in autumn is considerably mixed. However, these warming effects cannot carry over to the following year, possibly due to the fact that under the extreme weather in winter the mosquito fully ceases from development and survives in terms of diapause eggs. Conclusions: As the historical pattern of global warming manifests seasonal fluctuations, this study provides corroborating and previously ignored evidence of how such seasonality affects the mosquito development. Understanding this short-term temperature-driven mechanism as one chain of the transmission events is critical to refining the thermal reaction norms of the epidemic vector under global warming as well as developing effective mosquito prevention and control strategies. © 2017 The Author(s).","**Classification:** RP, XU  **Explanation:**  *   **RP:** The paper models and projects the impact of different warming scenarios on the *Aedes albopictus* mosquito population, which is a direct impact on human health (dengue fever). *   **XU:** The paper does not provide United States specific information.

10.1111/gcb.12960,Increased evapotranspiration demand in a Mediterranean climate might cause a decline in fungal yields under global warming,"Wild fungi play a critical role in forest ecosystems, and its recollection is a relevant economic activity. Understanding fungal response to climate is necessary in order to predict future fungal production in Mediterranean forests under climate change scenarios. We used a 15-year data set to model the relationship between climate and epigeous fungal abundance and productivity, for mycorrhizal and saprotrophic guilds in a Mediterranean pine forest. The obtained models were used to predict fungal productivity for the 2021-2080 period by means of regional climate change models. Simple models based on early spring temperature and summer-autumn rainfall could provide accurate estimates for fungal abundance and productivity. Models including rainfall and climatic water balance showed similar results and explanatory power for the analyzed 15-year period. However, their predictions for the 2021-2080 period diverged. Rainfall-based models predicted a maintenance of fungal yield, whereas water balance-based models predicted a steady decrease of fungal productivity under a global warming scenario. Under Mediterranean conditions fungi responded to weather conditions in two distinct periods: early spring and late summer-autumn, suggesting a bimodal pattern of growth.

10.1002/joc.2004,Predicting the impact of global warming on the timing of spring flowering,"Many plants flower in response to a change in the environment. Since one of the main goals for a plant is to complete a growth cycle in order to produce seed, flowering is a key stage in plant development. We have developed a statistical procedure for explaining the variations in flowering date, which is based on a well-accepted phenological model (growing degree-days). Our approach has several advantages over previous methods based around multiple-regression procedures, the main one being that we have a direct interpretation in terms of just two meaningful phonological parameters (thermal requirement and thermal threshold) per species. The model is used to classify 79 flowering plants. By using a statistical approach based on empirical p-values, we can decide which species can be regarded as sensitive to temperature. Our model, while a simplification of the real system, is easy to work with and enables the consequences of future temperature change to be predicted. By adopting a simple (linear), but realistic, approximation to the rise in temperature each spring, we derive a simple expression for the change in expected flowering dates under global warming. We use the expression to examine changes under three different climate change scenarios involving increasing warmth, oceanicity and continentality. Variations in flowering from species to species and year to year are explained in a straightforward manner by variations in our two parameters and the linear temperature functions, respectively. We find that the sensitivity of spring flowering dates to temperature is strongly governed by the continentality of the climate. We make predictions that will allow the assumptions used in constructing our model to be validated or repudiated. Our formulae can be used for any global warming scenario of the type we consider, whenever our basic assumptions hold.

10.1111/gcb.12692,Do cities simulate climate change? A comparison of herbivore response to urban and global warming,"Cities experience elevated temperature, CO2, and nitrogen deposition decades ahead of the global average, such that biological response to urbanization may predict response to future climate change. This hypothesis remains untested due to a lack of complementary urban and long-term observations. Here, we examine the response of an herbivore, the scale insect Melanaspis tenebricosa, to temperature in the context of an urban heat island, a series of historical temperature fluctuations, and recent climate warming. We survey M. tenebricosa on 55 urban street trees in Raleigh, NC, 342 herbarium specimens collected in the rural southeastern United States from 1895 to 2011, and at 20 rural forest sites represented by both modern (2013) and historical samples. We relate scale insect abundance to August temperatures and find that M. tenebricosa is most common in the hottest parts of the city, on historical specimens collected during warm time periods, and in present-day rural forests compared to the same sites when they were cooler. Scale insects reached their highest densities in the city, but abundance peaked at similar temperatures in urban and historical datasets and tracked temperature on a decadal scale. Although urban habitats are highly modified, species response to a key abiotic factor, temperature, was consistent across urban and rural-forest ecosystems.

Results show that by the late 21st century, the increased global warming is expected to induce a 12-fold increase in the area extent affected by heat stress of high-risk level. This would result in an increase of about 10%-30% in the number of days with high-risk heat conditions, as well as about 6%-20% in their magnitude throughout the seasonal cycle over West, Central, and North-East Africa.

10.1007/s12192-023-01325-0,Transgenerational transmission of environmental effects in livestock in the age of global warming,"Recent decades provide mounting evidence for the continual increase in global temperatures, now termed global warming, to the point of drastic worldwide change in the climate. Climatic change is a long-term shift in temperatures and weather patterns, including increased frequency and intensity of extreme environmental events such as heat waves accompanied by extreme temperatures and high humidity. Climate change and global warming put several challenges to the livestock industry by directly affecting the animal's production, reproduction, health, and welfare. The broad impact of global warming, and in particular heat stress, on-farm animals' performance has been comprehensively studied. It has been estimated that the US livestock industry's loss caused by heat stress is up to $2.4 billion annually. However, the long-term intergenerational and transgenerational effects of climatic change and global warming on farm animals are sparse. Transgenerational effects, which are mediated by epigenetic mechanisms, can affect the animal's performance regardless of its immediate environment by altering its phenotypic expression to fit its ancestors' environment. In many animal species, environmental effects are epigenetically encoded within a narrow time interval during the organism's gametogenesis, and these epigenetic modifications can then be intergenerationally transmitted. Several epigenetic mechanisms mediate intergenerational transmission of environmental effects, typically in a parent-dependent manner. Therefore, exposure of the animal to an extreme climatic event and other environmental stressors during gametogenesis can undergo epigenetic stabilization in the germline and be passed to the offspring. As a result, the offspring might express a phenotype adjusted to fit the stressors experienced by their ancestors, regardless of their direct environment. The purpose of this perspective is to review current evidence for intergenerational and transgenerational transmission of environmental stress effects, specifically in the context of global warming and climate change, and to offer viewpoints on the possible impacts on the livestock industry.","**RO, RP**  This paper should be included because it discusses observed and projected direct impacts of climate change (specifically heat stress) on the livestock industry, which is a relevant sector for the U.S. National Climate Assessment.

","This paper should be classified with the following codes:  - RP: Reports projected direct impacts - XV: Not valued in economic terms - XU: No United States specific information  Explanation:  The paper addresses projected impacts of global warming on livestock, particularly through the lens of epigenetic and transgenerational effects, which are relevant direct impacts. However, while it mentions the U.S. livestock industry's losses due to heat stress, it appears to focus on the biological mechanisms and long-term projections rather than providing specific economic valuations or U.S.-specific data. Additionally, the economic loss figure provided is not directly tied to the paper’s novel analysis or new evidence for the purposes of the National Climate Assessment.",RO RP,Ambiguous,Ambiguous,4,NA,Missing
10.1016/j.atmosres.2023.106812,Three-dimensional-based global drought projection under global warming tendency,"Global warming is anticipated to largely impact drought dynamics. Therefore, a comprehensive projection of global drought under various future warming levels is critical for water resources management. This study investigated the changes in the severity, intensity, area, and duration of droughts at 1.5 degrees C, 2 degrees C, 3 degrees C, and 4 degrees C of global warming above pre-industrial levels based on the latest simulations under climate change scenarios from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). The Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) at 3-month time scale was adopted to characterize seasonal droughts. The results show that: 1) Global land is projected to experience a significant nonlinear increasing trend of drought severity, intensity, areal extent, and duration during the 21st century, and drought characteristics have the highest growth rate under the 3 degrees C warming scenario, followed by the 4 degrees C, 2 degrees C, and 1.5 degrees C warming scenarios. 2) Under the 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C warming levels, drought characteristics in most land areas change slightly compared to the baseline period of 1995-2014. 3) Hotspots defined as robust increases in drought severity appear in the 3 degrees C and 4 degrees C warming world, including northern South America, Europe, northern and southern Africa, western and central Asia, and central Australia, whereas eastern North America and the Russian Arctic exhibit substantial reduction in drought severity under different global warming levels. 4) Global warming is projected to change the timing of droughts, leading to more frequent summer droughts in Europe. Overall, the findings of this study provide a scientific basis for articulating future global drought adaption and highlight the need for mitigation measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions to achieve the 2 degrees C target of the Paris Agreement.","Include: RP, XU  Explanation: The paper projects direct impacts (drought) under different warming scenarios, making it relevant. However, the study focuses on global drought projections and explicitly highlights areas outside the U.S., making it not U.S.-specific and therefore XU. While it mentions eastern North America, the overall global focus is the reason to code it XU. ","This paper should not be included in the review. Classify it with the following code:  - XU: No United States specific information  Although the paper provides valuable insights into global drought projections, it does not provide specific information or analysis related to the United States, which is essential for the U.S. National Climate Assessment.",Ambiguous,XU,Ambiguous,2,NA,Missing
10.3390/world5040054,Modeling the Impact of Global Warming on Ecosystem Dynamics: A Compartmental Approach to Sustainability,"Environmental degradation driven by human activities has heightened the need for sustainable development strategies that balance economic growth with ecological preservation. This study uses a compartmental model approach to examine the effects of global warming on ecosystem dynamics, focusing on how rising temperatures alter interactions across trophic levels. Three case studies of varying complexity, including a human ecosystem incorporating social and economic factors, were analyzed by integrating feedback loops between greenhouse gas emissions, temperature anomalies, and ecosystem responses. The results quantitatively demonstrate that even minor disruptions in one part of an ecosystem can cause significant instability across trophic levels, potentially driving the system to collapse in a short period. These findings from all case studies highlight the cascading impacts of global warming, underscoring the intricate relationship between climate change and ecosystem stability. Furthermore, this study offers qualitative insights into the potential consequences of climate change on biodiversity and resource availability in real ecosystems, highlighting the vulnerability of such systems and the importance of incorporating feedback mechanisms into environmental policy and decision-making processes. The approach employed in this study offers a more robust framework for understanding ecosystem responses and for developing strategies to enhance resilience against climate change, thereby protecting the long-term sustainability of ecosystems.","**RP, XU**  The paper models the projected impacts of global warming on ecosystem dynamics, which falls under direct impacts. However, the abstract doesn't mention any specific focus on the United States. ","Based on the abstract provided, this paper should be included in the review. It employs a compartmental model to analyze the effects of global warming on ecosystem dynamics, focusing on temperature-related interactions across trophic levels.

10.1016/j.enpol.2009.06.068,Fossil-fuel constraints on global warming,"In 2008 and 2009 two papers by Kharecha and Hansen and by Net and Cooper examined possible fossil energy availability and energy consumption scenarios and consequences for future climate. The papers yield somewhat similar results regarding atmospheric CO2 levels, but they reach substantially different conclusions regarding future climate change. Here, we compare their methods and results. Our work shows that Net and Cooper's paper significantly underestimates future warming. Net and Cooper conclude that even if all the available fossil fuels would be burned at the maximum possible rate during this century, the consequent warming would cap at less than 1 degrees C above the 2000 level. We find that under Net and Cooper's assumption of an intensive exploitation of fossil fuels - the global temperature in 2100 will likely reach levels which would lead to severely damaging long-term impacts.

It suggests that one model underestimates future warming, which could lead to severely damaging long-term impacts. Therefore, it reports projected direct impacts. ",This paper should not be included in the review for the U.S. National Climate Assessment. It focuses on the global impacts of fossil fuel availability on future climate scenarios rather than exploring direct climate impacts specifically related to the United States.
