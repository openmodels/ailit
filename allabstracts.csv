10.1016/j.jcomm.2024.100423,"The challenges posed by climate change on the agricultural market have become a pressing concern. An accurate reading of future agricultural commodity prices can be an invaluable planning instrument for diverse interested parties. Here, we explore asset pricing implications of climate risk for the agricultural commodity market from January 2005 to December 2021. Through introducing a composite climate risk index based on the four individual climate risk measures of Faccini et al. (2023), our findings provide valuable insights into the time-series predictability of aggregate climate risk on future agricultural commodity returns, both in- and out-of-sample. This powerful predictability conveys substantial economic benefits to mean–variance investors and cannot be subsumed by conventional economic predictor variables. The evidence further suggests that physical risk, especially global warming, exhibits much stronger return predictability than transition risk. Moreover, we emphasize the pivotal role of climate risk in shaping supply dynamics and capturing investor attention, thereby serving as potential drivers of return predictability. Overall, these predictive insights hold important implications for risk management, investment strategies, and policy formulation in the agricultural commodity market. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."
10.1016/j.eneco.2024.107968,"Climate policy uncertainty (CPU), driven by the need to address climate extremes and environmental degradation, significantly impacts the strategic corporate investments (CI) of energy firms. This study examines the influence of CPU on CI within the energy sector, with a particular focus on the moderating role of corporate social responsibility (CSR). Utilizing an empirical approach and a dataset of U.S. energy firms, the research reveals that CPU negatively affects CI, even after controlling for firm-specific factors such as size, financial leverage, and profitability. The study also uncovers a complex relationship between CSR and CI under conditions of CPU. While CSR is beneficial for firms' long-term growth and financial health by promoting sustainable practices, it can also intensify the negative impact of CPU on CI for firms with limited financial resources. The findings highlight the critical need to investigate the interplay between CPU, CSR, and CI in the energy sector. This research contributes to energy economics by providing insights into how CPU and CSR shape CI, offering a nuanced perspective on the dual role of CSR in the context of CPU. The results are of academic significance and have practical implications for corporate strategy, policymaking, and investment decisions in an industry central to global climate action and economic progress. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."
10.1016/j.jeem.2024.103047,"This paper improves our understanding of how rainwater impacts economic growth by investigating the effects of overlooked properties of the water cycle. First, we consider the natural separation of rainwater into flows of blue water (i.e., the water that runs off towards rivers) and green water (i.e., that remaining in the soil). Second, we account for the presence of surface and groundwater stocks. These considerations allow us to comprehensively address the whole partition of rainwater, which, upon reaching the ground, splits into distinct water resources that determine water availability inland. Our analyses on a global panel coupling sub-national economic and hydrological data show that rainwater does increase growth, but do so differently depending on its partition. Specifically, blue water leads to more economic growth than green water at the margin, but, because two thirds of terrestrial water is green, the latter contributes more to growth in total. By missing this crucial partition, we find that commonly used rainwater measurements overstate rainwater's contribution to growth (by about two). Our analyses further indicate that, although groundwater reserves always mitigate the impacts of rainwater reduction on growth, surface water reserves sometimes amplify regional dependence to rainwater (depending on sector, income and reserve types). © 2024 Elsevier Inc."
10.1038/s41586-024-08020-9,"Global emission reduction efforts continue to be insufficient to meet the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement1. This makes the systematic exploration of so-called overshoot pathways that temporarily exceed a targeted global warming limit before drawing temperatures back down to safer levels a priority for science and policy2–5. Here we show that global and regional climate change and associated risks after an overshoot are different from a world that avoids it. We find that achieving declining global temperatures can limit long-term climate risks compared with a mere stabilization of global warming, including for sea-level rise and cryosphere changes. However, the possibility that global warming could be reversed many decades into the future might be of limited relevance for adaptation planning today. Temperature reversal could be undercut by strong Earth-system feedbacks resulting in high near-term and continuous long-term warming6,7. To hedge and protect against high-risk outcomes, we identify the geophysical need for a preventive carbon dioxide removal capacity of several hundred gigatonnes. Yet, technical, economic and sustainability considerations may limit the realization of carbon dioxide removal deployment at such scales8,9. Therefore, we cannot be confident that temperature decline after overshoot is achievable within the timescales expected today. Only rapid near-term emission reductions are effective in reducing climate risks. © The Author(s) 2024."
10.1016/j.jag.2024.104086,"The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita is one of the most widely used socioeconomic indicators, serving as an integral component for climate change impact analysis. However, a national scale assessment may induce considerable bias because it conceals any internal variations within a country. The lack of a long-term sub-national scale GDP data is a substantive hinderance. Leveraging the close relationship between nighttime lights and GDP, we address this gap by developing a novel methodological framework in two steps. First, under the modeling philosophy of spatial statistics, we developed a novel approach based on deep and machine learning techniques to establish a complex mapping between two inconsistent nighttime lights (NTL) datasets: the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP) and the National Polar-Orbiting Partnership's Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). The models achieve accuracies ranging from 0.945 to 0.980 (correlation coefficients). By taking the estimations ensemble of the two techniques, the time series of DMSP data was extended to 2021. Next, a novel modeling strategy based on multi-layer perceptron was developed to derive the non-linear relationship between NTL and GDP per capita at sub-national scale to alleviate scale effects at this granularity, while explicitly capturing regional heterogeneity effect. The trained models achieve average accuracies of 0.967, 0.959, and 0.959 on the training, validation, and test sets, respectively. We evaluate the developed dataset at the global, national, and sub-national scales from various perspective, and the results offer solid evidence on the reliability of the estimated economic data. By linking to historical global climate change data, we quantify global economic losses attributed to extreme heat to demonstrate how the estimated GDP data can be useful in the climate change impact analysis. © 2024 The Author(s)"
10.3390/cli12080110,"In rainfed areas, precipitation variations directly impact wheat growth stages such as emergence, tillering, jointing and booting, and maturity. Evaluating the impact of climate change on precipitation patterns during these critical growth stages is crucial for adapting climate change and ensuring global food security. In this study, projections of five General Circulation models (GCMs) under two shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) were used to predict the changing characteristics of precipitation during four main growth stages of wheat in the rainfed region of the Pothwar Plateau, Pakistan. Historical datasets of daily precipitation at six weather stations were analyzed to check the past changes in the precipitation patterns. During the baseline period (1985–2014), the annual average precipitation decreased at a rate of −9.75 mm/decade, while the amount of precipitation during the rabi season (wheat-growing season) decreased at a rate of −20.47 mm/decade. An increase in the precipitation was found during the fourth (flowering) stage of crop growth, while the first three stages experienced a decrease in the precipitation amount. The multimodal ensembled data, under the SSP2-4.5 scenario, revealed a significant decline (at the rate of −16.63 mm/decade) in the future annual precipitation. However, it is projected that, under SSP2-4.5, there may be a slight increase (4.03 mm/decade) in the total precipitation amount during the future rabi season. Under the SSP5-8.5 scenario, average annual precipitation exhibited a slightly increasing trend, increasing by 1.0 mm/decade. However, during the rabi season, there was a possibility of a decrease in precipitation amount, with a rate of 11.64 mm/decade. It is also expected that the precipitation amount may vary significantly during the crown root initiation, jointing and booting, and flowering stages in the near future. These results provide a framework for the planning of wheat production in the Pothwar region of Pakistan, taking into account the potential impact of shifting weather patterns, particularly in terms of uneven precipitation. © 2024 by the authors."
10.1016/j.envsoft.2024.106121,"The Full of Economic-Environment Linkages and Integration dX/dt (FeliX) model is a System Dynamics-based Integrated Assessment Model (IAM), explicitly incorporating human behaviors and their dynamic interactions among global systems. This paper presents FeliX 2.0, describing the detailed framework and key interactions among nine integrated modules. FeliX 2.0 refined its original version in population dynamics, food and land use systems, and socioeconomic settings for poverty analysis. Robust calibration is applied to key variables against their historical data since 1950. Future projections of multiple variables up to 2100 demonstrate coherences between FeliX 2.0 and the IAMs used in IPCC assessments. Both outputs (the robust calibration results and future projections) underscore the efficacy of FeliX 2.0 in capturing complex interdependencies within global systems. FeliX 2.0 stands as an informative tool and offers insights into interactions within the human-Earth system and the analysis of complex economic-environmental-social challenges in short- and long-term future. © 2024 The Authors"
10.1016/j.eneco.2024.107758,"We examine the effect of rising temperatures on regional economic development, using annual sub-national data for over 1500 regions in 152 countries between 1990 and 2017. In a panel setting with region- and country-year fixed effects, we find no evidence of a homogeneous or heterogeneous effect of rising temperatures on economic development as measured by regional per capita income. Additionally, we find no non-linear relationship between temperature and economic development. We also employ a long-difference approach that is attuned to exploring the long-run relationship between rising temperatures and regional income. Results indicate that rising temperatures have a negative long-run impact on regional per capita income for a minority of regions located in countries with weak economic, legal and political institutions. Furthermore, these vulnerable regions experience a decline in long-term population and human capital development. The use of alternative regional per capita GDP data from 1950 onwards yields similar empirical results. Our findings suggest that negative economic effects of temperature increase with time, only becoming apparent in the long run for regions in already disadvantaged countries. Thus, country-specific conditions may moderate regional economic vulnerability to future temperature increases due to global climate change. © 2024 The Authors"
10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.171704,"Greenhouse gas emissions are considered the culprit of extreme high temperatures, and low-carbon transformation has become a global consensus. The low-carbon action by enterprises is an inevitable choice if they are to adapt to economic and social needs. Green innovation is an important measure for enterprises to respond to the challenges of low-carbon transformation. This study mainly discusses the causal relationship between extreme high temperatures and green innovation of enterprises. Using China's industrial enterprise database, we construct county-annual panel data from 2000 to 2013. Results show that extreme high temperatures improve the level of green innovation of enterprises. After a series of robustness tests, the results remain. Mechanism analysis shows that extreme high temperatures increase the environmental concerns of the government, the public, and society, thus strengthening government regulation, public participation, and social supervision as well as encouraging enterprises to carry out green innovation. Our heterogeneous analysis shows that in the eastern region with a high level of legal system and economic development, it is easier to promote green innovation for enterprises. In addition, large-scale enterprises are more willing to carry out green innovation after experiencing a heat wave. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

10.1016/j.jeem.2024.102970,"Short-term weather forecasts, a common and popular public good in the modern world, affect labor decisions regarding time allocations. This study uses a novel dataset of city-level day-ahead weather forecasts in China, collected through video transcriptions of the country's popular TV program spanning over 2000 days since 2010. I estimate the number of hours laborers worked in a day as flexible functions of the daily maximum temperature forecast under different historical levels of forecast accuracy (represented by half-year rolling daily maximum temperature forecast root-mean-squared-error, RMSE). The results suggest large-magnitude (up to 4.5 and 1.2 h per day) labor decreases under uncomfortable temperature forecasts (extreme heat above 30∘C and medium cold 15∘C–25∘C), but only when forecasts are accurate (RMSE≈1∘C). The economic value of accurate weather forecasts is assessed by modeling this labor adaptation to forecasts. Specifically, 930 Yuan (148 USD, in 2015 currency) is gained per worker per year, with each 1∘C decrease in the city forecast RMSE. For the entire country, an average 3.9% increase in city-level forecast accuracy for 2011–2015 generates a considerable social benefit of 25.3 billion Yuan (4.03 billion USD) annually from the labor sector alone, nearly covering the annual cost of the national weather forecasting system. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."
10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.170866,"The recurrent occurrence of extreme weather events poses a significant threat to agricultural production, food security, and sustainable economic development. Understanding farmers' adaptive responses to cope with these challenges is pivotal for informing and implementing effective climate resilience policies. This study utilizes the Spatial Precipitation Index (SPI) to assess rainfall patterns and applies fixed effects methods to analyze extreme rainfall shocks' impact on rural households, using panel data from China's 2006–2015 National Rural Fixed Point Survey. Below are the results. Firstly, both drought and rainstorm shocks negatively affect agricultural yield and income, highlighting farmers' vulnerability to extreme rainfall events. Secondly, farmers respond to these shocks by reallocating labor from agriculture to non-agricultural sectors or migrating to urban areas, with these labor mobility patterns typically being temporary. Thirdly, there's notable heterogeneity linked to household affluence. Less affluent rural households experienced more pronounced declines in yield and income, compelling higher migration rates. Collectively, our findings shed light on how Chinese rural households strategically adjust their labor decisions to respond to extreme rainfall shocks through inter-sectoral and inter-regional labor mobility. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."
10.1016/j.strueco.2023.10.006,"Emerging economies (EMEs) often ignore effective mitigation strategies for persistent climate changes to prioritise growth acceleration. This paper shows that they cannot sustain their economic growth due to the adverse impact of temperature rise on total factor productivity (TFP). Using a standard growth model, it demonstrates how temperature rise and variation for growing carbon emissions reduce capital productivity along with the damage to ecosystem services and labour productivity, adversely impacting total factor productivity (TFP) of an individual economy. A cross-sectional augmented auto-regressive distributed lag model (CS-ARDL), which addresses the issues of endogeneity, heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence with stochastic trends, has been applied to 21 EMEs over the period from 1990 to 2018 and reveals a strong negative impact of temperature rise on total factor productivity. Although EMEs have heterogeneous impacts across the countries depending upon their climatic zones and income levels, one degree increase in temperature, on average, has decreased the TFP by approximately 3.22 per cent. It is much higher in the extreme climatic zones and less developed economies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V."
10.1016/j.jafr.2024.100978,"The East of Africa is the least developed region, the most food insecure and the most difficult development challenges in the world. The article review examines seventy-six peer-reviewed articles on climate-linked food insecurity and economic development in the East Africa mostly published 2017–2023. The study evaluates to what extent the literature provides, explain, and illustrate the numerous linkages between climate change, food insecurity and economic development. This study includes two sections; the first section examines the food insecurity, which is a result of violent conflict brought on by the effects of climate change; the second section examines an integrated approach to address conflict related climate change and food insecurity. According to the study, decreased agricultural and economic productivity as a result of climate change is a factor in conflict. Food insecurity and conflict are mutually reinforcing and closely linked. In addition, to lessen the food insecurity, policies must employ conflict related climate change adaptive strategies. The distribution and management of land, water, and other natural resources need to be improved in order to resolve conflicts caused by climate change. For East Africa to develop a successful strategy for addressing conflict-related climate change, participation in the development of resource-sharing agreements and land-use planning needs to be strengthened. Local natural resource management and identification of possible conflict hotspots using early warning, risk assessments, and scenario analysis were suggested as ways to lessen the effects of conflict due to climate change. The key policy implication is that the best strategies to promote long-term food security are to establish the rule of law, set high standards for regulation, protect property rights, establishing national frameworks for resolving climate-related conflicts, and settle conflicts. © 2024 The Authors"
10.1111/risa.14194,"To explore whether climate risk (CR) affects renewable energy technological innovation (RETI) and its boundary conditions, this study examines the relationship between CR and RETI as moderated by institutional environment. Based on panel data of 60 countries for the period 2000–2019, we show that CR is not conducive to RETI, and that its negative marginal impact shows an inverted U-shaped trend with the improvement of RETI. Heterogeneity analysis shows that floods and storms have the greatest negative impacts on RETI, and that innovations in solar and wind energy technologies are more vulnerable to the adverse shocks of CR. Furthermore, CR has a greater adverse effect on RETI in developing countries than in developed countries. However, the institutional environment, especially the economic institutional environment, can work to mitigate the negative effect of CR on RETI. Our findings not only enrich the research on the economic consequences of CR but also provide effective ways to mitigate the adverse impact of CR on RETI from the perspective of institutional environment. © 2023 Society for Risk Analysis."
10.1016/j.irfa.2024.103096,"There is a growing awareness that climate change is a new source of risk to the financial system, but cross-country evidence on the impact of climate risk on financial stability is lacking. This study empirically investigates the impact of climate risk on financial stability using panel data from 2007 to 2019 in 53 countries. The findings of this study reveal that climate risk negatively affects financial stability, and this adverse impact will show differences due to the different levels of economic development, financial development, and competition among countries. Furthermore, macroprudential policies have effectively maintained the financial stability of countries affected by climate risk. However, the macroprudential policies imposed on borrowers are different from balance-based and buffer-based macroprudential tools. In addition, good national governance quality can contain the impact of climate risk on financial stability. After suffering from climate risk, strengthening political stability, improving government efficiency, supervision, and legal system, strictly controlling corruption and improving the right to speak and accountability are conducive to the country's maintenance of financial stability to varying degrees. This study not only enriches the existing research in the field of climate financial risk, but also provides a reference for government departments to reduce the impact of climate risk and maintain financial stability. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."
10.1007/s11430-023-1443-0,"Economic feasibility is crucial for achieving the carbon neutrality target. However, current integrated assessments often underestimate the economic impacts of mitigation policies due to the lack of consideration of their economic benefits. This study integrates a warming-labour productivity model with a typical integrated assessment model using shared socioeconomic pathways. It simulates China’s economic development and carbon emission levels under both baseline and carbon-neutral policy scenarios, evaluating the economic costs and benefits of emission reduction policies aimed at achieving carbon neutrality. These findings reveal the following: (1) The economic costs of emission reduction policies are projected to peak between 2050 and 2060, ranging from 0.41% to 9.37% of total GDP in the baseline scenario, primarily due to increased energy prices and R&D investments. These costs are expected to decline rapidly after 2070. (2) China’s carbon-neutral policies will mitigate global warming, with the economic benefits of mitigation projected to reach 5.65% to 17.24% of China’s total GDP by 2100. (3) Low-carbon scenarios SSP1 and SSP4 could significantly reduce initial economic costs and advance the onset of net economic gains to 2060. This integrated assessment confirms that China’s carbon neutrality target offers substantial net economic benefits in the long term. To minimize initial economic costs, efforts should focus on enhancing consumption-side transitions, upgrading low-carbon technologies, and adopting new energy sources. © Science China Press 2024."
10.1002/ijfe.2952,"This work explores the role of weather shocks, measured as temperature deviations from their normal, in affecting GDP growth through a panel of 148 countries, spanning the period 1960–2019 and a panel quantile approach. The findings show that GDP growth is negatively affected by such deviations at higher quantiles, with the results receiving robust support from three alternative methodologies. The analysis also identifies two channels through which the findings receive further support, such as, the ‘heat-exposed’ sectors effect on labour productivity, and the impact of temperature deviations on the capital accumulation capacity. The results also survive the role of the country development status. Finally, the analysis identifies the role of the countries' geographical location.

10.1080/17565529.2022.2074349,"Women in developing countries are more exposed to the adverse effects of climate change. We develop a structural model to study the long-term impacts of climate and socioeconomic changes on labour supply and the pay gap between male/female and high-skilled/low-skilled labour. We calibrate our model with empirical evidence on the impacts of increasing temperatures on labour availability in two general economic sectors with high and low exposure to rising temperatures. Using five waves of nationally representative micro-survey data in South Africa from 2008 to 2017, we find that while high-skilled labour availability is insensitive to climate change, higher temperatures have a negative impact on working hours of low-skilled labour specially among women in the high-exposure sector. We incorporate these findings in an overlapping generations (OLG) model to show that climate-induced reduction in labour availability increases the relative wages of low-skilled female labour and reduces the wage gap between male and female labour in the high-exposure sector, and between high-skilled and low-skilled female labour, in general. Considering climate change damages both on sectoral productivity and on labour availability, we project that by the end of the century, the output per adult will drop by about 11 percentage points under a severe climate scenario. This calls for more targeted adaptation policies that build on the potential benefits of climate change in reducing gender inequality and empowering women to take up more active roles in designing and implementing such policies at the local level. © 2022 The Author(s).

Environmental aid flows aim to alleviate the rising concerns of climate change in the developing world. Even though the existing literature has examined the effectiveness of green aid flows for reducing carbon dioxide emissions in the recipient countries, no existing study has examined the effectiveness of different classifications of green aid. Examining the green aid flows to 97 developing countries between 2002 and 2018, we find that all types of green aid significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions; however, the aid flows targeting the environmental objectives are more effective in reducing carbon dioxide emissions compared to the aid flows that do not target environmental objectives or are not screened. The findings highlight that more aid should be screened and targeted for environmental objectives to increase the effectiveness of green aid flows in developing countries. © 2023, The Author(s)."

10.1002/joc.8077,"In this study, the new gridded daily precipitation dataset REGEN (Rainfall Estimates on a Gridded Network) was used to verify the performance of 23 global climate models participating in the 6th phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) in terms of extreme precipitation over global and continents during 1950–2014. Projected changes were also evaluated using CMIP6 multi-model ensemble (MME) under different Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) by the end of the 21st century. Although positive biases exist in the climatology of most extreme precipitation indices simulated by the CMIP6 MME compared with observations, most of the CMIP6 models can reproduce the spatial distribution characteristics and temporal evolution trends of global extreme precipitation. The simulation is improved by using the CMIP6 MME, relative to the results from individual models. The projected results showed that in most regions of the world, extreme precipitation will significantly increase in the future, with more significant increase under higher SSPs. By the end of the 21st century, total precipitation of wet days (PRCPTOT), simple daily intensity (SDII), the number of very heavy rain days (R20mm), maximum 1-day precipitation (Rx1day) and maximum consecutive 5-day precipitation (Rx5day) over the global will increase by up to 50%, 20%, 70%, 50% and 50%, respectively, under the SSP5-8.5 scenario. Nevertheless, marked uncertainties exist in the projection of extreme precipitation in South America and in the global for consecutive dry days (CDD) index. Noteworthy, average PRCPTOT, Rx1day and Rx5day over Asia, Europe and North America, as well as of the whole world, have significantly increased where the CDD index is also higher, shown by projected results. In summary, global extreme precipitation will increase in the future, and precipitation will become more uneven in space and time. Moreover, as the SSP scenario becomes higher, the uneven distribution of precipitation will become more pronounced. © 2023 Royal Meteorological Society."
10.3390/cli11060119,"South Asia is the most vulnerable region in the context of global warming, climate change, and climate risk. Climate finance is the most useful tool for combating climate challenges worldwide. The study explores the present picture of climate finance in South Asian (SA) countries. The study uses multilateral development bank (MDB), Green Climate Fund (GCF), and Germanwatch supplied data from 2011 to 2021. Under the theoretical lens of institutional capacity development, the study attempts to correlate climate finance and climate risk. The study indicates an increasing trend of MBDs’ and the GCF’s climate finance in many countries worldwide. The study finds that MDBs’ total global climate finance is USD 446,977 million, while the SA region has received USD 59,301 million since 2011. It also reports that MDBs provide 77% and 23% of the money to the mitigation and adaptation areas. Moreover, the study reports that, after COVID-19, MDBs substantially increased the amount of global climate financing, but this increase was not seen in the SA region. Our climate risk data indicate that most of the SA countries are highly long-term climate risky and lose, on average, 0.378% of GDP. The correlation matrix finds a negative and significant correlation between climate finance and long-term and yearly climate risk. The study identifies that the region’s climate financing flow of money is not rationally distributed based on the short-run and long-run climate risks. The study presumes that more climate finance would be the most effective mechanism to mitigate climate risk. Therefore, SA region leadership drastically requires a holistic framework to address the prevailing climate problems and to ensure regional coordination and cooperation toward climate finance and policies.

10.1016/j.enpol.2023.113475,"Climate change is the defining challenge of our time with complex and evolving dynamics. The effects of climate change on economic output and financial stability have received considerable attention, but there has been much less focus on the relationship between climate change and income inequality. In this paper, we provide new evidence on the association between climate change and income inequality, using a large panel of 158 countries during the period 1995–2019. We find that an increase in climate change vulnerability is positively associated with rising income inequality. More interestingly, splitting the sample into country groups reveals a considerable contrast in the impact of climate change on income inequality. While climate change vulnerability has no statistically significant effect on income distribution in advanced economies, the coefficient on climate change vulnerability is seven times greater and statistically highly significant in the case of developing countries due largely to weaker capacity for climate change adaptation and mitigation. These findings are robust with alternative estimation methods and measures of income inequality, but it should be noted that the appropriate measurement of climate change vulnerability and resilience remains a challenge that imposes limits on empirical analysis. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"
10.1007/s11356-022-22312-5,"This paper analyzes the effect of certain factors on electricity consumption in Spain at a sectoral level. An electricity consumption function has been estimated by using panel data, depending on gross value added (GVA), temperatures, capitalization, and human capital. This function is obtained for total productive electricity consumption and for the agricultural, construction, industrial, service, and public administration sectors, referring to the 17 Autonomous Communities of Spain for the 2000–2013 period. The obtained results show important sectoral differences in the effect that GVA has on electricity consumption, indicating a positive and increasing effect of temperatures above 22 °C in the total economy and in the tertiary sector, and a negative effect of temperatures below 18 °C in some sectors. These results may indicate that global warming may induce an electricity demand growth in Spain, especially related to cooling needs. The results also highlight the positive effects of capitalization in all sectors, and the negative effects of human capital, except for the public administration sector. In this context, it may be appropriate to carry out policies that mitigate this consumption growth, reinforcing energy efficiency measures, and human capital investments. © 2022, The Author(s)."

(2001). The world in context: beyond the business case for sustainable development. Cambridge: HRH The Prince of Wales' Business and the Environment Programme, Cambridge Programme for Industry.; Stern, N. (2006). Stern Review executive summary. New Economics Foundation.). Emissions from carbon-intensive sectors can be linked to potential liabilities caused by extreme weather and hydrological events, such as extreme rainfall and flooding. The risks these events present may not be reflected in current equity or bond prices (Krosinsky et al., Evolutions in sustainable investing: strategies, funds and thought leadership, John Wiley & Sons, 2012). Consequently, financiers and investors need tools to assess the climate risks of portfolio holdings. Financial supervisors and regulators also need to identify downside risks. We propose a framework which may be helpful for estimating investment losses based on firms' historical carbon emissions. Our framework would also allow the sensitivity of losses to uncertain inputs to be explored for climate risk stress-testing. We further develop and refine Rayer et al.

The principal idea is that a company's knowledge of the climate damage its emissions have caused, together with its subsequent willingness to accept responsibility to address the harms caused is incorporated, which is likely to reflect a societal judgment. Our framework enables financial market practitioners and policymakers to estimate, for individual listed companies, potential equity or bond price falls arising from a company's historical emissions following climate change induced extreme weather or climate events. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.

10.3390/rs15040970,"The rapid loss of Arctic Sea ice cover and thickness diminishes the surface albedo, which increases the ocean’s absorption of solar heat and exacerbates the Arctic amplification effect. According to the most recent research from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the Sixth Assessment Report (IPCC, AR6), the extent of summer sea ice is anticipated to decrease below 1 million km2 by the 2050s as a result of the extreme climate. Nevertheless, past and future changes in sea ice albedo radiative forcing and the resulting economic cost remain to be explored in systematic and multi-disciplinary manners. In this study, we first analyze the evolution of Arctic sea ice radiative forcing (SIRF) from 1982 to 2100 using a radiative kernel method based on albedo data from the Polar Pathfinder-Extent (APP-x) and Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5). Then, the SIRF is converted to CO2 equivalent emissions via the Dynamic Integrated Model of Climate and Economy (DICE) model. Finally, the associated costs are calculated using the substitute cost method, based on the social cost of carbon to achieve the Paris Agreement targets. The results show that the average Arctic SIRF was −0.75 ± 0.1 (Formula presented.) between 1982 and 2020, and increased by 0.12 (Formula presented.) during this period. The SIRF in April–June accounts for nearly 77% of the average annual value, with a maximum absolute value of –3.2 (Formula presented.) in May. Through model transformation, it is shown that the Arctic SIRF rising leads to global warming comparable to the effect of an increase of 34.5 Gt of CO2 in the atmosphere relative to pre-industrialization, and results in a loss of 24.4–48.8 trillion USD for climate regulation service (CRS). From 2020 to 2100, in the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5, the Arctic SIRF is projected to increase by 0.31 (Formula presented.). Combined with the discount rate, the estimated average annual cost over the period ranges from 6.7–13.3 trillion USD. These findings provide a systematic understanding of the radiative effect of Arctic sea ice change on the global climate and the corresponding economic cost. © 2023 by the authors."
10.1007/978-3-031-15703-5_27,"Climate change affects the functioning of all of the components of food systems, often in ways that exacerbate existing predicaments and inequalities among regions of the world and groups in society. At the same time, food systems are a major cause of climate change, accounting for a third of all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Therefore, food systems can and should play a much bigger role in climate policies. This chapter highlights nine action points for climate change adaptation and mitigation in food systems. The chapter shows that numerous practices, technologies, knowledge and social capital already exist for climate action in food systems, with multiple synergies with other important goals, such as the conservation of biodiversity, the safeguarding of ecosystem services, sustainable land management and reducing social and gender inequalities. Many of these solutions are presently being applied at local scales around the world, even if not at sufficient levels. Hence, the major effort to unleash their potential would involve overcoming various technical, political-economic and structural barriers for their much wider application. Some other solutions require research and development investments now, but will focus on helping us meet the longer-term challenges of climate change in regard to food systems in the second half of this century, when most existing food production practices will face unprecedented challenges. In the short term, these pro-poor policy changes and support systems can have a range of positive effects well beyond food systems without delay. In the long term, investments in research will help ensure food security and ecosystem integrity for coming generations. © The Author(s) 2023."
10.3389/fevo.2023.1169427,"Introduction: Global climate change, increase in human activities, and prominence of ecological issues have led to uneven quantitative and spatial distributions of carbon emission and sequestration of terrestrial ecosystems. Such uneven distributions can lead to more negative impacts on the natural environment and human living conditions. Methods: Therefore, based on the carbon neutralization policy, we conducted geographically weighted regression (GWR) modeling in this study using panel data from 352 Chinese prefectural administrative districts in 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2017 to analyze and determine the impact factors and their spatial distribution for carbon emission and sequestration of terrestrial ecosystems. Results: Our results showed that total population (TP), per capita gross domestic product (GDP) (PCG), proportion of secondary industry output (PSIO), scale of urban built-up area (SUB), green space proportion in city areas (GSP), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and temperature (TEM) are factors driving carbon sequestration and carbon emission. The spatial distribution of these driving factors in mainland China is: (1) TP showed a negative correlation to carbon emission in most areas, while it exhibited a positive correlation to carbon sequestration in the southern, southwestern, and western parts of northwest China; however, in all other areas, TP showed a negative correlation with carbon sequestration; (2) PCG was positively correlated to carbon emission in most areas of China and to carbon sequestration in southwest, south, central, and northeast China; however, PCG demonstrated a negative correlation to carbon sequestration in the remaining areas; (3) PSIO and SUB presented a positive correlation to carbon emission and a negative correlation to carbon sequestration in most areas; (3) In contrast, GSP showed a negative correlation to carbon emission and a positive correlation to carbon sequestration in most areas; (5)NDVI showed a negative correlation to carbon emission and carbon sequestration in most areas toward the east of the “Heihe-Tengchong Line”; NDVI was positively correlated to both carbon emission and sequestration toward the west of this line; (6)TEM was positively correlated to carbon emission and sequestration in most parts of China. Discussion: Based on these results, we further divided the Chinese cities into 6 groups: (1) Groups 1, 2, 3, and 6 are areas where carbon emission and sequestration are governed by both socioeconomic and natural ecological factors. The major driving factors of carbon emission and carbon sequestration in group 1 are PSIO, GSP, and NDVI; the driving factors of group 2 are SUB and NDVI. Meanwhile, carbon emission and sequestration in group 3 are governed by PCG, GSP, and NDVI; for group 6, carbon emission and sequestration are controlled by PCG, SUB, GSP, and NDVI; (2) Group 4 represents areas where carbon emission and sequestration are majorly impacted by PCG and SUB, thereby rendering socioeconomic factors as the major driving forces. Group 5 represents areas where carbon emission and sequestration are sensitive to the natural environment, with GSP and NDVI being the driving factors. Considering the uneven distribution of carbon sequestration and emission and the diverse driving factors in different areas of China, we provided guidance for future environmental policies aimed at reducing the uneven distribution of carbon sequestration and emission in different areas to achieve carbon neutralization.

10.1016/j.hlc.2022.12.001,"Background and Aims: A robust climate-health projection model has the potential to improve health care resource allocation. We aim to explore the relationship between Australian intensive care unit (ICU) demand and various measures of the long-lived large-scale climate and to develop a future nationwide climate-health projection model. Methods: We investigated patients admitted to ICUs in Australia between January 2003 and December 2019 who were exposed to long-lived large-scale combined climatic measures of temperature and humidity. We analysed the projected demand for respiratory-related ICU average length of stay (in days) per capita (ICUD/C) with four historical and one future projection dataset. These datasets included: i) Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society adult patient database, ii) Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center gridded global historical population, iii) Australian Bureau of Statistics national historical population, iv) Japanese 55-year Reanalysis historical climate (JRA55), and v) the fifth Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project future climate projections. Results: 148,638 patients with respiratory issues required intensive care between 2003 and 2019. The annual growth in the population density-weighted wet-bulb-globe temperature—a combined measure of temperature and humidity—is strongly correlated with the annual per capita growth ICUD/C for respiratory-related conditions (r=0.771; p<0.001). This relationship was applied to develop a model projecting future respiratory-related ICU demand with three possible future Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP). RCP2.6 (lowest carbon emission climate scenario) showed only a 33.4% increase in Australian ICUD/C demand by 2090, while the RCP8.5 (highest carbon emission climate scenario) demonstrated almost two-fold higher demand (66.1%) than RCP2.6 by 2090. Conclusions: The annual growth in population density-weighted wet-bulb-globe temperature correlates with the annual growth in Australian ICUD/C for respiratory-related conditions. A model based on possible future climate scenarios can be developed to predict changes in ICU demand in response to CO2 changes over the coming decades. © 2022 Australian and New Zealand Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons (ANZSCTS) and the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand (CSANZ)"
10.3389/fenvs.2023.1048525,"This paper assesses the relevance and outcome of involving a transdisciplinary group of stakeholders in a scenario-building research project. The scenarios describe plausible external, long-term conditions with the aim to improve the knowledge basis of a national (Norwegian) government pursuing climate policy targets for 2030 and 2050 under uncertainty. The scenario process has two phases with quite different roles for the participants. In the first, the aim is to create broad engagement and participation in exploring narratives for how key external conditions might develop and form premises for the national climate strategies for Norway. The ambition in this phase is to deduce a handful of wide-ranging and distinctly different, qualitative scenarios. The second phase is devoted to translating the narratives into quantitative projections for the Norwegian economy and greenhouse gas emissions by means of linking global and national largescale models. We claim that research projects building and using scenarios have significant potential to benefit from involving a broad stakeholder group in developing qualitative narratives. The second phase involves complex quantitative simulations. In order to provide scientific rigor and credibility to the scenarios, this phase primarily calls for scholars with technical skills, knowledge on the research frontier and modelling experience. Nevertheless, later use of these scenarios in numerical policy studies can gain from resumed researcher-stakeholder interaction. Copyright © 2023 Fæhn and Stoknes."
10.1016/j.ecolecon.2022.107627,"More frequent and punctuated severe events such as dry spells are among the more salient manifestations of climate change. Because dry spells often co-occur both with heat waves and with longer-term agricultural drought and their effects may interact, understanding the effects of dry spells and heat waves requires a multi-timescale and multi-stressor perspective. Using a global panel of daily precipitation and temperature from 1979 to 2016, we provide evidence that 4–5 week dry spells that occur during the hottest part of the year depress growth in aggregate crop production. The effects of these extreme events are modified by existing drought, aridity, and by heat waves. Our findings, focused on punctuated events, multiple stressors, and aggregate crop production across the globe, complement prior investigations focused solely on longer-term phenomena, those that study extreme heat or precipitation in isolation, and studies that restrict attention to a small number of crops or locations. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."
10.3389/fevo.2022.1028485,"Climate change is having profound effects on natural and socio-economic systems, especially via extreme climate events. Using panel data from 129 prefectural-level cities in China from 2013 to 2019, this paper explores the effects of extreme climate on crime rates based on a climate index and manual collection of crime data. The results showed that extreme climate has a significant positive effect on crime rates, increasing by 0.035% for every 1% increase in the extreme climate index. This occurs through two mechanistic pathways: reduced agricultural output and lower employment income. The heterogeneity analysis shows that extreme climate has a greater impact on crime rates in eastern areas which are economically developed and have high levels of immigration. This study provides new perspectives on the impact of extreme climate on the economy and society, in which governments can actively participate in climate governance through environmental protection, energy conservation and emission reduction, and technological innovation to reduce crime rates by reducing the occurrence of extreme climate.

10.5194/nhess-22-2567-2022,"Sustainable flood risk management (SFRM) has become popular since the 1980s. Many governmental and non-governmental organisations have been keen on implementing the SFRM strategies by integrating social, ecological, and economic themes into their flood risk management (FRM) practices. However, the justifications for SFRM are still somewhat embryonic, and it is not yet clear whether this concept is influencing current policies in different countries. This paper reviews the past and current flood management experiences from flood defence to SFRM in four developed countries to highlight lessons for coastal megacities in development. The paper explores recent strategies such as ""Making Space for Water"", Planning Policy Statement 25 (PPS25), and the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) in the UK and ""Room for the River""in the Netherlands, which were implemented to mitigate flooding, integrate FRM with sustainability concepts, and deliver sound FRM practice for future generations. In this context, the United States has also established a National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), and in a different approach, Japan has developed an advanced flood warning and evacuation contingency system to prepare for climatic extremes. These case studies give good lessons in achieving long-term SFRM to deliver sound flood management practices considering socio-economic and environmental concerns. Most developing coastal megacities especially in Asia are still heavily reliant on a traditional hard-engineering approach, which may not be enough to mitigate substantial risks due to human factors (e.g. large population, rapid socio-economic growth, subsidence from excessive groundwater extraction) and natural factors (e.g. climate change including sea-level rise and land subsidence). It is clear that different countries and cities have their interpretation of SFRM, but this paper explores how policymakers can adopt ""mixed options""to move towards long-term thinking about sustainability with social, economic, and environmental considerations.

10.1007/s10584-022-03387-y,"Quantifying which nations are culpable for the economic impacts of anthropogenic warming is central to informing climate litigation and restitution claims for climate damages. However, for countries seeking legal redress, the magnitude of economic losses from warming attributable to individual emitters is not known, undermining their standing for climate liability claims. Uncertainties compound at each step from emissions to global greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations, GHG concentrations to global temperature changes, global temperature changes to country-level temperature changes, and country-level temperature changes to economic losses, providing emitters with plausible deniability for damage claims. Here we lift that veil of deniability, combining historical data with climate models of varying complexity in an integrated framework to quantify each nation’s culpability for historical temperature-driven income changes in every other country. We find that the top five emitters (the United States, China, Russia, Brazil, and India) have collectively caused US$6 trillion in income losses from warming since 1990, comparable to 14% of annual global gross domestic product; many other countries are responsible for billions in losses. Yet the distribution of warming impacts from emitters is highly unequal: high-income, high-emitting countries have benefited themselves while harming low-income, low-emitting countries, emphasizing the inequities embedded in the causes and consequences of historical warming. By linking individual emitters to country-level income losses from warming, our results provide critical insight into climate liability and national accountability for climate policy. © 2022, The Author(s)."
10.1016/j.fmre.2022.03.010,"Global climate governance has entered the era of carbon neutrality, as a growing number of countries have set the goal of carbon neutrality for long-term emissions reduction toward the mid-21st century. In 2020, China also pledged itself to the goal of carbon neutrality, which creates an urgent demand for this country to establish a systematic and integrated national climate governance system. Against this background, this paper conducts a systematic literature review of climate governance systems from the perspectives of top-level design and the governance paradigm to bring insights into climate governance toward carbon neutrality. The results show that although there are interactions between decarbonization and other environmental, social and economic fields, research gaps still exist when enhancing climate governance toward carbon neutrality. For example, issues regarding incorporating climate factors into the overall economic and social layout, strengthening the capacity of data collection relevant to climate adaptation, integrating climate mitigation and adaption actions, as well as connecting domestic climate governance and international cooperation, need to be further addressed. In addition, within the national governance system, studies combining both regional and sectoral concerns and the intertemporal dynamic allocation mechanism need to be further addressed when China decomposes its national climate target. Moreover, the division of power between the central government and local government, as well as the communication scheme between government and non-state actors, also turns out to be important for effective governance. Based on this analysis, policy implications are further proposed for China's formulation and implementation of long-term strategies of climate governance toward carbon neutrality. © 2022"

The study uses data from 1995 to 2018 and utilizes Nonlinear Panel Autoregressive Distributed Lag (NPARDL) method. Our findings show that the major economies (including G20) realize positive economic growth with increasing long-run energy diversification. However, some countries (e.g., OECD and G20) experience negative economic growth due to energy diversification in the short term. The results also disclose that energy diversification does not favor economic growth in low-income economies, both short and long terms.

10.3390/ijerph19052523,"Background: The long-term effect of abnormal climate on cognitive function and socioeconomic status remains elusive. We explored the association between prenatal exposure to climate anomaly and adulthood cognitive function and job reputation. Methods: We obtained repeated cognitive and job reputation measurements from 17,105 subjects for the years 2010, 2014, and 2018, and ascertained their birth date and other covariates. We used sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the Southern Pacific Ocean as the indicator for global climate anomaly in the main analyses. We calculated its averaged values for different gestational periods and analyzed its possible nonlinear associations with adulthood cognitive function and job reputation. We also calculated associated economic loss due to prenatal exposure to abnormal climate. Results: We found an inverted U-shaped curve between climate anomaly and adulthood cognition. During the entire pregnancy, for SST anomalies increasing/decreasing 1 °C from 0 °C, newborn individuals will have adulthood cognition (measured by math test) changed by −2.09% (95% confidence interval (CI): −2.31%, −1.88%) and −3.98% (95% CI: −4.32%, −3.65%), respectively. We observed a similar inverted U-shaped pattern for cognitive function measured by word test and job reputation. Such an association is likely to be mediated by regional meteorological conditions, not local ones. Subgroup analyses identified females and people from less-developed regions as even more vulnerable to prenatal abnormal climate, finding an interactive effect with other social factors. The economic loss was assessed as the salary reduction due to declined cognition among all newborn individuals in China. For SST anomalies increasing/decreasing by 1 °C from 0 °C, individuals born each year in China would earn 0.33 (95% CI: 0.40, 0.25) and 1.09 (95% CI:1.23, 0.94) billion U.S. dollars equivalent less in their annual salary at adulthood because of lowered cognitive function, respectively. Conclusion: Prenatal exposure to abnormal global climate patterns can result in declined adulthood cognitive function, lowered job reputation, and subsequent economic loss. © 2022 by the authors.

Here, using a global panel of subnational economic output for 1,554 regions worldwide over the past 40 years, we show that economic growth rates are reduced by increases in the number of wet days and in extreme daily rainfall, in addition to responding nonlinearly to the total annual and to the standardized monthly deviations of rainfall. Furthermore, high-income nations and the services and manufacturing sectors are most strongly hindered by both measures of daily rainfall, complementing previous work that emphasized the beneficial effects of additional total annual rainfall in low-income, agriculturally dependent economies4,7. By assessing the distribution of rainfall at multiple timescales and the effects on different sectors, we uncover channels through which climatic conditions can affect the economy.

By applying the Trace test of cointegration and the bounds test, results from our analysis show the existence of a long-run relationship between Carbon Dioxide emissions and economic growth, trade openness, population density and energy consumption. In addition, the results support the EKC hypothesis for (CO2) emissions in the long and short-term, assuming an inverted U-shaped relationship between environmental quality and income. These ﬁndings are also demonstrated by the impulse response function to analyze dynamics and shocks between the pollutant emissions and the above exogenous variables.

Using a panel data set of 174 countries over the years 1960 to 2014, we find that per-capita real output growth is adversely affected by persistent changes in the temperature above or below its historical norm, but we do not obtain any statistically significant effects for changes in precipitation. We also show that the marginal effects of temperature shocks vary across climates and income groups. Our counterfactual analysis suggests that a persistent increase in average global temperature by 0.04 °C per year, in the absence of mitigation policies, reduces world real GDP per capita by more than 7 percent by 2100. On the other hand, abiding by the Paris Agreement goals, thereby limiting the temperature increase to 0.01 °C per annum, reduces the loss substantially to about 1 percent. These effects vary significantly across countries depending on the pace of temperature increases and variability of climate conditions. The estimated losses would increase to 13 percent globally if country-specific variability of climate conditions were to rise commensurate with annual temperature increases of 0.04 °C. © 2021 Elsevier B.V."

A continuation of historical trends will leave 350 million people globally in extreme poverty by 2030. Without progressive redistribution, climate policies would push an additional 50 million people into poverty. However, redistributing the national carbon pricing revenues domestically as an equal-per-capita climate dividend compensates this policy side effect, even leading to a small net reduction of the global poverty headcount (−6 million). An additional international climate finance scheme enables a substantial poverty reduction globally and also in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Here, we present a structural equation model integrating emissions and economic and energy system characteristics over the period 1970–2016 to empirically assess mechanisms that influence the GDP-CO2 relationship for 73 countries. Robust to various model specifications and statistical tests, we found a simple unitary scale effect between per capita GDP and per capita CO2 emissions, while five emission-reduction mechanisms, principally energy system decarbonization and productivity gains, collectively contributed to global emission reductions by 19 petagrams.

10.1038/s41467-021-22211-2,"The large majority of climate change mitigation scenarios that hold warming below 2 °C show high deployment of carbon dioxide removal (CDR), resulting in a peak-and-decline behavior in global temperature. This is driven by the assumption of an exponentially increasing carbon price trajectory which is perceived to be economically optimal for meeting a carbon budget. However, this optimality relies on the assumption that a finite carbon budget associated with a temperature target is filled up steadily over time. The availability of net carbon removals invalidates this assumption and therefore a different carbon price trajectory should be chosen. We show how the optimal carbon price path for remaining well below 2 °C limits CDR demand and analyze requirements for constructing alternatives, which may be easier to implement in reality. We show that warming can be held at well below 2 °C at much lower long-term economic effort and lower CDR deployment and therefore lower risks if carbon prices are high enough in the beginning to ensure target compliance, but increase at a lower rate after carbon neutrality has been reached. © 2021, The Author(s)."
10.1073/pnas.2024792118,"Increased exposure to extreme heat from both climate change and the urban heat island effect—total urban warming—threatens the sustainability of rapidly growing urban settlements worldwide. Extreme heat exposure is highly unequal and severely impacts the urban poor. While previous studies have quantified global exposure to extreme heat, the lack of a globally accurate, fine-resolution temporal analysis of urban exposure crucially limits our ability to deploy adaptations. Here, we estimate daily urban population exposure to extreme heat for 13,115 urban settlements from 1983 to 2016. We harmonize global, fine-resolution (0.05°), daily temperature maxima and relative humidity estimates with geolocated and longitudinal global urban population data. We measure the average annual rate of increase in exposure (person-days/year−1) at the global, regional, national, and municipality levels, separating the contribution to exposure trajectories from urban population growth versus total urban warming. Using a daily maximum wet bulb globe temperature threshold of 30 °C, global exposure increased nearly 200% from 1983 to 2016. Total urban warming elevated the annual increase in exposure by 52% compared to urban population growth alone. Exposure trajectories increased for 46% of urban settlements, which together in 2016 comprised 23% of the planet’s population (1.7 billion people). However, how total urban warming and population growth drove exposure trajectories is spatially heterogeneous. This study reinforces the importance of employing multiple extreme heat exposure metrics to identify local patterns and compare exposure trends across geographies. Our results suggest that previous research underestimates extreme heat exposure, highlighting the urgency for targeted adaptations and early warning systems to reduce harm from urban extreme heat exposure. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

At the same time, emissions of carbon dioxide reported to have decreased that imply global climate change. Furthermore, the climate change due to a reduction in CO2 emissions during the COVID-19 pandemic affected the demand and supply side of goods and services which in turn had an impact on the economy. One of important indicators in macroeconomics is the inflation rate. Therefore, this study aims to examine the impact of climate change due to the reduction of CO2 emissions during the COVID-19 pandemic and Coronavirus disease on inflation and food inflation in Indonesia. This study uses time series daily data and analysis using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). The result show that the number of COVID-19 cases has a negative effect on both inflation and food inflation, while the number of recovered cases has a positive effect on both dependent variables. The number of death is only significant to the inflation rate, but it is not significant to the food inflation. The variable of temperature as a proxy variable of climate change has negative influence to the food inflation, but it has not any effects to the inflation rate. In addition, the level of citizen compliance with physical distancing will determine the level of CO2 emission reduction.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd."
10.1038/s41586-021-03190-2,"A large scholarship currently holds that before the onset of anthropogenic global warming, natural climatic changes long provoked subsistence crises and, occasionally, civilizational collapses among human societies. This scholarship, which we term the ‘history of climate and society’ (HCS), is pursued by researchers from a wide range of disciplines, including archaeologists, economists, geneticists, geographers, historians, linguists and palaeoclimatologists. We argue that, despite the wide interest in HCS, the field suffers from numerous biases, and often does not account for the local effects and spatiotemporal heterogeneity of past climate changes or the challenges of interpreting historical sources. Here we propose an interdisciplinary framework for uncovering climate–society interactions that emphasizes the mechanics by which climate change has influenced human history, and the uncertainties inherent in discerning that influence across different spatiotemporal scales. Although we acknowledge that climate change has sometimes had destructive effects on past societies, the application of our framework to numerous case studies uncovers five pathways by which populations survived—and often thrived—in the face of climatic pressures. © 2021, Springer Nature Limited."
10.1016/j.gfs.2020.100488,"The potential impacts of climate change on current livestock systems worldwide is a major concern, and yet the topic is covered to a limited extent in global reports such as the ones produced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In this article, we review the risk of climate-related impacts along the land-based livestock food supply chain. Although a quantification of the net impacts of climate change on the livestock sector is beyond the reach of our current understanding, there is strong evidence that there will be impacts throughout the supply chain, from farm production to processing operations, storage, transport, retailing and human consumption. The risks of climate-related impacts are highly context-specific but expected to be higher in environments that are already hot and have limited socio-economic and institutional resources for adaptation. Large uncertainties remain as to climate futures and the exposure and responses of the interlinked human and natural systems to climatic changes over time. Consequently, adaptation choices will need to account for a wide range of possible futures, including those with low probability but large consequences. © 2021"
10.1017/sus.2021.2,"Non-Technical summary We summarize some of the past year's most important findings within climate change-related research. New research has improved our understanding of Earth's sensitivity to carbon dioxide, finds that permafrost thaw could release more carbon emissions than expected and that the uptake of carbon in tropical ecosystems is weakening. Adverse impacts on human society include increasing water shortages and impacts on mental health. Options for solutions emerge from rethinking economic models, rights-based litigation, strengthened governance systems and a new social contract. The disruption caused by COVID-19 could be seized as an opportunity for positive change, directing economic stimulus towards sustainable investments. Technical summary A synthesis is made of ten fields within climate science where there have been significant advances since mid-2019, through an expert elicitation process with broad disciplinary scope. Findings include: (1) a better understanding of equilibrium climate sensitivity; (2) abrupt thaw as an accelerator of carbon release from permafrost; (3) changes to global and regional land carbon sinks; (4) impacts of climate change on water crises, including equity perspectives; (5) adverse effects on mental health from climate change; (6) immediate effects on climate of the COVID-19 pandemic and requirements for recovery packages to deliver on the Paris Agreement; (7) suggested long-Term changes to governance and a social contract to address climate change, learning from the current pandemic, (8) updated positive cost-benefit ratio and new perspectives on the potential for green growth in the short-and long-Term perspective; (9) urban electrification as a strategy to move towards low-carbon energy systems and (10) rights-based litigation as an increasingly important method to address climate change, with recent clarifications on the legal standing and representation of future generations.

10.1002/9781119413738.ch10,"Across the globe, the negative impacts of extreme heat have become increasingly apparent to individuals, policymakers, public health scientists, physiologists, climatologists, and economists. Extreme heat exposures in occupational settings can have detrimental impacts on the whole of society. Understanding the full impact requires quantifying trade-offs between what may be valued economically as part of society (work output) and human health. The heat load affecting one's body––a combination of environmental and personal factors––can significantly affect thermoregulation, particularly for those completing physically demanding work in environmentally stressful conditions. In such situations, an imbalance occurs between high metabolic heat production and the ability of the body to dissipate heat, as controlled by the environment. The spectrum of physiological impacts from heat strain implicates a worker's health, with new research connecting occupational heat stress to worker productivity and overall well-being, both of which relate to long-term economic resilience under a changing climate. This chapter provides an overview of common methods used to quantify heat stress and related health effects in occupational settings, presents insights into the impacts of climate change on health and productivity in specific regions of the world, and brings forth future perspectives and guidance for practical heat impact prevention approaches. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Inc."
10.1017/nie.2021.35,"Climate change and weather shocks have multi-faceted impacts on food systems with important implications for economic policy. Combining a longitudinal household survey with high-resolution climate data, we demonstrate that both climate and weather shocks increase food insecurity; cash assistance and participation in Ethiopia's Productive Safety Net Programme have reduced food insecurity; but food assistance has been ineffective. Importantly, households with savings, and those that stored their harvest to sell at higher prices rather than for home use, suffered less from food insecurity, yet both strategies are harder for the poorest and most food insecure households to adopt. Our paper provides micro-founded evidence needed to design policies that both improve agricultural yields in the context of a changing climate and target households' abilities to cope with shocks that put upwards pressure on food prices.  © 2021 The Author(s).

10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2020.101743,"Motivated by the prevalence of corporate sustainability and the rise of uncertainty at the national level, we investigate the impact of three sources of uncertainty; namely, economic policy, climate change, and political instability, on firms' sustainability performance. Using a sample of 6804 firms from 72 countries spanning 15 years, our study revealed that uncertainty due to climate change, economic policy, and political instability negatively affects firms' sustainability performance. This finding is in line with the real options theory that uncertainty in an external environment discourages firms' long-term investment (e.g. investment in corporate sustainability). In addition, the results show that the option for delay in sustainability investment moderated the relation between uncertainty at the national level and firms' sustainability performance. Firms with better sustainability performance had higher firm value when facing uncertainty. Interestingly, firms with higher profitability performed better in sustainability when facing uncertainty at the national level. © 2020 Elsevier B.V."
10.3390/ijerph17228562,"This narrative review examined strategies for preparedness and response to mental health impacts of three forms of climate change from a services perspective: (1) acute and extreme weather events such as hurricanes, floods, and wildfires, (2) sub-acute or long-term events such as droughts and heatwaves; and (3) the prospect of long-term and permanent changes, including higher temperatures, rising sea levels, and an uninhabitable physical environment. Strategies for acute events included development and implementation of programs and practices for monitoring and treating mental health problems and strengthening individual and community resilience, training of community health workers to deliver services, and conducting inventories of available resources and assessments of at-risk populations. Additional strategies for sub-acute changes included advocacy for mitigation policies and programs and adaptation of guidelines and interventions to address the secondary impacts of sub-acute events, such as threats to livelihood, health and well-being, population displacement, environmental degradation, and civil conflict. Strategies for long-lasting changes included the implementation of evidence-based risk communication interventions that address the existing and potential threat of climate change, promoting the mental health benefits of environmental conservation, and promoting psychological growth and resilience. © 2020 by the authors.

10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113298,"Global climate change has the potential to disrupt agricultural systems, undermine household socioeconomic status, and shape the prevalence and distribution of diseases. Each of these changes may influence children's nutritional status, which is sensitive to food availability, access, and utilization, and which may have lasting consequences for later-life health and socioeconomic outcomes. This paper contributes to the emerging literature on climate and child health by studying the effects of temperature and precipitation exposures on children's height and weight in Indonesia. Drawing on five rounds of the Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS) implemented between 1993 and 2015, we estimate fixed-effects regression models of height-for-age (HFA) and weight-for-height (WFH) among samples of children ages 24–59 months and 0–23 months, respectively. We test for heterogeneity in these effects across sub-populations expected to vary in their vulnerability. Results show that delays in monsoon onset are consistently associated with worse child health outcomes. Delays in monsoon onset during the prenatal period are associated with reduced child height among children age 2–4 years. The weight of young (<2 years) children is adversely affected by delays in the most recent monsoon season, and this relationship is particularly strong among residents of Java. Overall, our results underline the need for interventions that protect children's nutrition and underlying health against the effects of climate change. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"
10.1016/j.jeem.2020.102360,"We present a novel data set of subnational economic output, Gross Regional Product (GRP), for more than 1500 regions in 77 countries that allows us to empirically estimate historic climate impacts at different time scales. Employing annual panel models, long-difference regressions and cross-sectional regressions, we identify effects on productivity levels and productivity growth. We do not find evidence for permanent growth rate impacts but we find robust evidence that temperature affects productivity levels considerably. An increase in global mean surface temperature by about 3.5°C until the end of the century would reduce global output by 7–14% in 2100, with even higher damages in tropical and poor regions. Updating the DICE damage function with our estimates suggests that the social cost of carbon from temperature-induced productivity losses is on the order of 73–142$/tCO2 in 2020, rising to 92–181$/tCO2 in 2030.

10.1038/s43017-020-0079-1,"Restrictions to reduce human interaction have helped to avoid greater suffering and death from the COVID-19 pandemic, but have also created socioeconomic hardship. This disruption is unprecedented in the modern era of global observing networks, pervasive sensing and large-scale tracking of human mobility and behaviour, creating a unique test bed for understanding the Earth System. In this Perspective, we hypothesize the immediate and long-term Earth System responses to COVID-19 along two multidisciplinary cascades: energy, emissions, climate and air quality; and poverty, globalization, food and biodiversity. While short-term impacts are dominated by direct effects arising from reduced human activity, longer-lasting impacts are likely to result from cascading effects of the economic recession on global poverty, green investment and human behaviour. These impacts offer the opportunity for novel insight, particularly with the careful deployment of targeted data collection, coordinated model experiments and solution-oriented randomized controlled trials, during and after the pandemic. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited."

Yet many corporate and financial leaders are increasingly focused on the urgent need to forestall far graver long-term risks by more firmly reorienting the economy toward a zero-carbon future. Despite the severity of the immediate health and economic crises, a growing number of top global companies are publicly committing to net-zero goals. Oil-and-gas giants BP and Shell recently took multibillion-dollar write-downs on their fossil fuel assets, a telling sign of a gathering energy transition, and BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has begun screening investments for their climate implications. Dozens of the world’s central bankers recently underscored the links between the two crises, calling the pandemic “a real-life stress test of what we could potentially experience in an increasingly unstable climate.” Enormous political and economic obstacles remain, and much hinges on the US election and the course of the pandemic.

10.1039/9781788012744-00008,"Meeting the ambitious long-Term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement necessitates far-reaching changes in the global energy system and economy. Understanding both physical constraints on this transition, as well as economic constraints on the deployment of various technologies, can help to assess what role carbon capture and storage (CCS) can play in achieving this transition over the remainder of the century. This chapter reviews the necessary physical climate science to understand the role of CCS in limiting warming. We describe how the concept of a finite ""carbon budget"" arises out of interactions between the carbon-cycle and the rest of the climate system. A clear physically-based requirement for achieving the long-Term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement is the necessity of reaching global net-zero carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere. Based on this insight, we undertake a high-level but informative decomposition of Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) emissions reduction scenarios into contributions arising from the substitution of demand for carbon dioxide, and from the sequestration of carbon dioxide. In all scenarios that allow for the availability of CCS, the cost-effective solution offsets 20% or greater of business-As-usual end-of-century CO2 emissions with CCS and/or negative emissions technologies. We highlight the need for the sequestered fraction of extracted carbon, a potentially useful climate policy measure, to rise to reach unity in order to limit warming to any value and describe a near-Term schedule for increases in this fraction compatible with IAM-simulated cost-effective pathways that succeed in meeting the Paris Agreement long-Term temperature goal. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020."
10.3390/en12244644,"This study aims to explore the casual relationship between agricultural production, economic growth and carbon dioxide emissions in Pakistan. An autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model is applied to examine the relationship between agricultural production, economic growth and carbon dioxide emissions using time series data from 1960 to 2014. The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF), Phillips-Perron (PP) and Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) tests are used to check the stationarity of variables. The results show both short-run and long-run relationships between agricultural production, gross domestic product (GDP) and carbon dioxide emissions in Pakistan. From the short-run estimates, it is found that a 1% increase in barley and sorghum production will decrease carbon dioxide emissions by 3% and 4%, respectively. The pairwise Granger causality test shows unidirectional causality of cotton, milled rice, and sorghum production with carbon dioxide emissions. Due to the aforementioned cause, it is essential to manage the effects of carbon dioxide emissions on agricultural production. Appropriate steps are needed to develop agricultural adaptation policies, improve irrigation facilities and introduce high-yielding and disease-resistant varieties of crops to ensure food security in the country. © 2019 by the authors."
10.3390/su11236783,"The recent IPCC Special Report on global warming of 1.5 °C emphasizes that rapid action to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is vital to achieving the climate mitigation goals of the Paris Agreement. The most-needed substantial upscaling of investments in GHG mitigation options in all sectors, and particularly in manufacturing sectors, can be an opportunity for a green economic development leap in developing countries. Here, we use the Brazilian manufacturing sectors as an example to explore a transformation of its economy while contributing to the Paris targets. Projections of Brazil's economic futures with and without a portfolio of fiscal policies to induce low carbon investments are produced up to 2030 (end year of Brazil's Nationally Determined Contribution-NDC), by employing the large-scale macro econometric Energy-Environment-Economy Model, E3ME. Our findings highlight that the correct mix of green stimulus can help modernize and decarbonize the Brazilian manufacturing sectors and allow the country's economy to grow faster (by up to 0.42% compared to baseline) while its carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions decline (by up to 14.5% in relation to baseline).

A new emphasis in this literature has been to exploit the intertemporal properties of panel data to value the environment. These panel methods have great potential, but the literature needs to develop theoretical and empirical best practices. The article also examines the latest empirical results across several environmental issues: climate change, pollution, and conservation. Valuation methods continue to be applied to additional issues and locations. Looking toward the future, technical change and economic growth suggest that additional pollutants and global-scale effects will emerge.

10.1007/s10584-019-02500-y,"Climate researchers use carbon dioxide emission scenarios to explore alternative climate futures and potential impacts, as well as implications of mitigation and adaptation policies. Often, these scenarios are published without formal probabilistic interpretations, given the deep uncertainty related to future development. However, users often seek such information, a likely range or relative probabilities. Without further specifications, users sometimes pick a small subset of emission scenarios and/or assume that all scenarios are equally likely. Here, we present probabilistic judgments of experts assessing the distribution of 2100 emissions under a business-as-usual and a policy scenario. We obtain the judgments through a method that relies only on pairwise comparisons of various ranges of emissions. There is wide variability between individual experts, but they clearly do not assign equal probabilities for the total range of future emissions. We contrast these judgments with the emission projection ranges derived from the shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs) and a recent multi-model comparison producing probabilistic emission scenarios. Differences on long-term emission probabilities between expert estimates and model-based calculations may result from various factors including model restrictions, a coverage of a wider set of factors by experts, but also group think and inability to appreciate long-term processes. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V."
10.1016/j.erss.2019.01.017,"The German Energiewende is facing new challenges with increasing shares of fluctuating renewable energies. Slow electricity grid extensions, restrictions in public perception as well as limited transformation progress in other sectors beside electricity cause major drawbacks in greenhouse gas mitigation. Power-to-X (PtX) technologies may be the missing link for a more resilient energy transition and provide both, renewable substitutes for fossil fuels as well as electricity grid balancing services owing to flexible operation and long-term storage abilities. Different PtX concepts proved operability in several worldwide distributed pilot projects. However, little is known yet about potential technical, monetary, societal and resource related scale-up limitations. In this paper, implications of these aspects for a large-scale energy system implementation are shown. From a technical perspective the concept of long-term flexible PtX operation modes is generally feasible and could become key for a more resilient future energy supply. However, economics are still the bottleneck for an extensive diffusion: in two scenarios for 2050 PtX may cause additional national annual energy costs between approx. 10 and 100 billion euros compared to an ongoing fossil fuel supply at current price conditions. Nevertheless, such expenses can be considered as reasonable in contrast to expenses for the compensation of climate change consequences of a future fossil fuel-based energy system. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd"
10.1073/pnas.1813951115,"Different regions of the world have had different historical patterns of emissions of carbon dioxide, other greenhouse gases, and aerosols as well as different land-use changes. One can estimate the net cumulative contribution by each region to the global mean radiative forcing due to past greenhouse gas emissions, aerosol precursors, and carbon dioxide from land-use changes. Several patterns stand out from such calculations. Some regions have had a common historical pattern in which the short-term offsets between the radiative forcings from carbon dioxide and sulfate aerosols temporarily led to near-zero radiative forcing during periods of exponential emissions growth with few emission controls. This happened for North America and Europe in the mid-20th century and China in the 1990s and 2000s. However, these same periods lead to a commitment to future radiative forcing from the carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that stay in the atmosphere long after the aerosols. For every region, this commitment to future radiative forcing (2018–2100) from emissions already in the atmosphere is larger than the cumulative radiative forcing to date (1900–2017). This comparison again highlights how the full radiative forcing from greenhouse gases is unmasked once the aerosol emissions are reduced to improve air quality. The relative contributions from various regions to global climate forcing depends more on the time the contributions are compared (e.g., now or 2100) and future development scenarios than on whether cumulative radiative forcing, ocean heat content, or temperature is used to compare regional contributions. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

Yet, annual temperatures and productivity can also vary greatly across space within countries. With this in mind, we revisit the relationship between temperature and economic growth using subnational short panel data for 10,597 grid cells across the terrestrial Earth. Our estimates from fitting a quadratic model to the data imply that cell-level economic growth in countries with below-median per-capita incomes is concave in temperature, with a maximum at about 16 °C. Our findings suggest that even with similar economic development within a country, climate vulnerability can vary at the regional level. Furthermore, as soon as we take into account the nonlinear relationship between temperatures and economic growth within countries, the impacts of temperature increases are found to be larger, compared to those that disregard such within-country heterogeneity. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd"
10.1007/s40812-018-0092-2,"In the climate domain, attribution is the process of determining the external forcings which are more likely to be responsible of the climate change which, in turn, affects global economic growth. These factors influence the climatic system by altering its properties including, for instance, the radiative balance. In this context, investigating the role of anthropogenic forcings toward natural factors in the global warming of the last decades is of paramount importance. Global climate models (GCMs) applied to attribution studies showed that the temperature increase in the second half of the twentieth century can be mainly imputable to the emissions of anthropogenic greenhouse gases. In this study we resort to a data-driven approach based on machine learning with the aim of analyzing the relationship between global temperature anomalies and natural and anthropogenic forcings. Our empirical findings fully agree with the results of GCMs attribution studies, and further shed light on the natural and anthropogenic drivers that, on a multivariate basis, exert the major influence on the global temperature. © 2018, Associazione Amici di Economia e Politica Industriale."
10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.02.021,"It is commonly accepted that women can be more vulnerable than men to the adverse environmental effects of climate change. This paper evaluates whether the unequal distribution of costs women bear as a result of climate change are reflected across broader macro-social institutions to the detriment of gender equality and women's rights. It argues that gender disparities in climate change vulnerability not only reflect preexisting gender inequalities, they also reinforce them. Inequalities in the ownership and control of household assets and rising familial burdens due to male out-migration, declining food and water access, and increased disaster exposure can undermine women's ability to achieve economic independence, enhance human capital, and maintain health and wellbeing. Consequences for gender equality include reductions in intra-household bargaining power, as women become less capable of generating independent revenue. Outside the home, norms of gender discrimination and gender imbalances in socio-economic status should increase as women are less able to participate in formal labor markets, join civil society organizations, or collectively mobilize for political change. The outcome of these processes can reduce a society's level of gender equality by increasing constraints on the advancement of laws and norms that promote co-equal status. I empirically test this relationship across a sample of developing states between 1981 and 2010. The findings suggest that climate shocks and climatic disasters exert a broadly negative impact on gender equality, as deviations from long-term mean temperatures and increasing incidence of climatological and hydro-meteorological disasters are associated with declines in women's economic and social rights. These effects appear to be most salient in states that are relatively less-democratic, with greater dependence on agriculture, and lower levels of economic development. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd"

10.1038/s41586-018-0071-9,"International climate change agreements typically specify global warming thresholds as policy targets1, but the relative economic benefits of achieving these temperature targets remain poorly understood2,3. Uncertainties include the spatial pattern of temperature change, how global and regional economic output will respond to these changes in temperature, and the willingness of societies to trade present for future consumption. Here we combine historical evidence4 with national-level climate5 and socioeconomic6 projections to quantify the economic damages associated with the United Nations (UN) targets of 1.5°C and 2°C global warming, and those associated with current UN national-level mitigation commitments (which together approach 3°C warming7). We find that by the end of this century, there is a more than 75% chance that limiting warming to 1.5°C would reduce economic damages relative to 2°C, and a more than 60% chance that the accumulated global benefits will exceed US$20 trillion under a 3% discount rate (2010 US dollars). We also estimate that 71% of countries - representing 90% of the global population - have a more than 75% chance of experiencing reduced economic damages at 1.5°C, with poorer countries benefiting most. Our results could understate the benefits of limiting warming to 1.5°C if unprecedented extreme outcomes, such as large-scale sea level rise8, occur for warming of 2°C but not for warming of 1.5°C. Inclusion of other unquantified sources of uncertainty, such as uncertainty in secular growth rates beyond that contained in existing socioeconomic scenarios, could also result in less precise impact estimates. We find considerably greater reductions in global economic output beyond 2°C. Relative to a world that did not warm beyond 2000-2010 levels, we project 15%-25% reductions in per capita output by 2100 for the 2.5-3°C of global warming implied by current national commitments7, and reductions of more than 30% for 4°C warming. Our results therefore suggest that achieving the 1.5°C target is likely to reduce aggregate damages and lessen global inequality, and that failing to meet the 2°C target is likely to increase economic damages substantially. © 2018 Macmillan Publishers Ltd., part of Springer Nature."
10.1098/rsta.2016.0460,"Empirical evidence suggests that variations in climate affect economic growth across countries over time. However, little is known about the relative impacts of climate change on economic outcomes when global mean surface temperature (GMST) is stabilized at 1.5°C or 2°C warming relative to pre-industrial levels. Here we use a new set of climate simulations under 1.5°C and 2°C warming from the 'Half a degree Additional warming, Prognosis and Projected Impacts' (HAPPI) project to assess changes in economic growth using empirical estimates of climate impacts in a global panel dataset. Panel estimation results that are robust to outliers and breaks suggest that within-year variability of monthly temperatures and precipitation has little effect on economic growth beyond global nonlinear temperature effects. While expected temperature changes under a GMST increase of 1.5°C lead to proportionally higher warming in the Northern Hemisphere, the projected impact on economic growth is larger in the Tro4pics and Southern Hemisphere. Accounting for econometric estimation and climate uncertainty, the projected impacts on economic growth of 1.5°C warming are close to indistinguishable from current climate conditions, while 2°C warming suggests statistically lower economic growth for a large set of countries (median projected annual growth up to 2% lower). Level projections of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita exhibit high uncertainties, with median projected global average GDP per capita approximately 5% lower at the end of the century under 2°C warming relative to 1.5°C. The correlation between climate-induced reductions in per capita GDP growth and national income levels is significant at the p<0.001 level, with lower-income countries experiencing greater losses, which may increase economic inequality between countries and is relevant to discussions of loss and damage under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2016.05.009,"This paper presents the overview of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and their energy, land use, and emissions implications. The SSPs are part of a new scenario framework, established by the climate change research community in order to facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation. The pathways were developed over the last years as a joint community effort and describe plausible major global developments that together would lead in the future to different challenges for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. The SSPs are based on five narratives describing alternative socio-economic developments, including sustainable development, regional rivalry, inequality, fossil-fueled development, and middle-of-the-road development. The long-term demographic and economic projections of the SSPs depict a wide uncertainty range consistent with the scenario literature. A multi-model approach was used for the elaboration of the energy, land-use and the emissions trajectories of SSP-based scenarios. The baseline scenarios lead to global energy consumption of 400–1200 EJ in 2100, and feature vastly different land-use dynamics, ranging from a possible reduction in cropland area up to a massive expansion by more than 700 million hectares by 2100. The associated annual CO2 emissions of the baseline scenarios range from about 25 GtCO2 to more than 120 GtCO2 per year by 2100. With respect to mitigation, we find that associated costs strongly depend on three factors: (1) the policy assumptions, (2) the socio-economic narrative, and (3) the stringency of the target. The carbon price for reaching the target of 2.6 W/m2 that is consistent with a temperature change limit of 2 °C, differs in our analysis thus by about a factor of three across the SSP marker scenarios. Moreover, many models could not reach this target from the SSPs with high mitigation challenges. While the SSPs were designed to represent different mitigation and adaptation challenges, the resulting narratives and quantifications span a wide range of different futures broadly representative of the current literature. This allows their subsequent use and development in new assessments and research projects. Critical next steps for the community scenario process will, among others, involve regional and sectoral extensions, further elaboration of the adaptation and impacts dimension, as well as employing the SSP scenarios with the new generation of earth system models as part of the 6th climate model intercomparison project (CMIP6). © 2017 The Authors"
10.1088/1748-9326/11/6/064008,"Climate change has been statistically proven to substantially influence the economy of early modern Europe, particularly in the long term. However, a detailed analysis of climate change and the economy of historical China remains lacking, particularly from a large-scale and quantitative perspective. This study quantitatively analyzes the relationship between climate change and the economy in late imperial China (AD 1600-1840) at the national level. This study also compares the findings on the relationship between climate change and the economy in late imperial China with those in early modern Europe. Results of multivariate regression and Granger causality analyses indicate that (1) climate change induces economic fluctuations in late imperial China, particularly in the long term; (2) given that the economic center is located in South China during the study period, temperature has a greater influence on the economy than precipitation; (3) the population of China is statistically proven to primarily act as consumers in the long term; and (4) given the long-term role of the Chinese population, the economic vulnerability in late imperial China under climate change is further increased and is higher than that in early modern Europe, whose population mainly acts as producers in the long term. In conclusion, the late imperial Chinese society has a high economic vulnerability to climate change. These findings revisit Malthusian theory and 'Great Divergence' theory by including the perspective of economic vulnerability under climate change during the study period. The role of the population must be investigated further to address the socioeconomic vulnerabilities under climate change. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd."
10.1038/nclimate2774,"Contributions to historical climate change have varied substantially among nations. These differences reflect underlying inequalities in wealth and development, and pose a fundamental challenge to the implementation of a globally equitable climate mitigation strategy. This Letter presents a new way to quantify historical inequalities among nations using carbon and climate debts, defined as the amount by which national climate contributions have exceeded a hypothetical equal per-capita share over time. Considering only national CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion, accumulated carbon debts across all nations from 1990 to 2013 total 250 billion tonnes of CO2, representing 40% of cumulative world emissions since 1990. Expanding this to reflect the temperature response to a range of emissions, historical climate debts accrued between 1990 and 2010 total 0.11 °C, close to a third of observed warming over that period. Large fractions of this debt are carried by industrialized countries, but also by countries with high levels of deforestation and agriculture. These calculations could contribute to discussions of climate responsibility by providing a tangible way to quantify historical inequalities, which could then inform the funding of mitigation, adaptation and the costs of loss and damages in those countries that have contributed less to historical warming. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited."
10.1016/j.eneco.2014.04.017,"This paper reviews the literature on the relationship between climate and the energy sector. In particular, we primarily discuss empirical papers published in peer-reviewed economics journals focusing on how climate affects energy expenditures and consumption. Climate will affect energy consumption by changing how consumers respond to short run weather shocks (the intensive margin) as well as how people will adapt in the long run (the extensive margin). Along the intensive margin, further research that uses household and firm-level panel data of energy consumption may help identify how energy consumers around the world respond to weather shocks. Research on technology adoption, e.g. air conditioners, will further our understanding of the extensive margin adjustments and their costs. We also note that most of the literature focuses on the residential sector. Similar studies are urgently needed for the industrial and commercial sectors. © 2014 Elsevier B.V."
10.1007/s10584-011-0149-y,"This paper summarizes the main characteristics of the RCP8.5 scenario. The RCP8.5 combines assumptions about high population and relatively slow income growth with modest rates of technological change and energy intensity improvements, leading in the long term to high energy demand and GHG emissions in absence of climate change policies. Compared to the total set of Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), RCP8.5 thus corresponds to the pathway with the highest greenhouse gas emissions. Using the IIASA Integrated Assessment Framework and the MESSAGE model for the development of the RCP8.5, we focus in this paper on two important extensions compared to earlier scenarios: 1) the development of spatially explicit air pollution projections, and 2) enhancements in the land-use and land-cover change projections. In addition, we explore scenario variants that use RCP8.5 as a baseline, and assume different degrees of greenhouse gas mitigation policies to reduce radiative forcing. Based on our modeling framework, we find it technically possible to limit forcing from RCP8.5 to lower levels comparable to the other RCPs (2.6 to 6 W/m2). Our scenario analysis further indicates that climate policy-induced changes of global energy supply and demand may lead to significant co-benefits for other policy priorities, such as local air pollution. © 2011 The Author(s)."

This finding suggests a tradeoff between the impacts of reducing emissions of aerosols and greenhouse gases. Results from a statistical model of historical rice harvests in India, coupled with regional climate scenarios from a parallel climate model, indicate that joint reductions in brown clouds and greenhouse gases would in fact have complementary, positive impacts on harvests.

10.1016/j.jeem.2020.102360,"We present a novel data set of subnational economic output, Gross Regional Product (GRP), for more than 1500 regions in 77 countries that allows us to empirically estimate historic climate impacts at different time scales. Employing annual panel models, long-difference regressions and cross-sectional regressions, we identify effects on productivity levels and productivity growth. We do not find evidence for permanent growth rate impacts but we find robust evidence that temperature affects productivity levels considerably. An increase in global mean surface temperature by about 3.5 degrees C until the end of the century would reduce global output by 7-14% in 2100, with even higher damages in tropical and poor regions. Updating the DICE damage function with our estimates suggests that the social cost of carbon from temperature-induced productivity losses is on the order of 73-142$/tCO(2) in 2020, rising to 92-181$/tCO(2) in 2030. These numbers exclude non-market damages and damages from extreme weather events or sea-level rise. (c) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc."
10.1007/s11356-018-2305-7,"Climate change is a global phenomenon. Its impact on economic growth must therefore be analyzed in accordance with its (time-varying) common effects. We present an econometric analysis that evaluates this effect taking into account its global nature. Contrary to previous evidence that ignores the global effects, we obtain that the rising temperature has not decreased growth in real GDP per capita in the second half of the twentieth century for the world countries. However, we obtain a negative effect of rising temperatures and a positive effect of rising precipitation in poor countries. This positive effect of rising precipitation is also confirmed for hot and temperate countries."
10.1016/j.eneco.2021.105624,"We study the long-term impact of climate change on economic activity across countries, using a stochastic growth model where productivity is affected by deviations of temperature and precipitation from their long-term moving average historical norms. Using a panel data set of 174 countries over the years 1960 to 2014, we find that per-capita real output growth is adversely affected by persistent changes in the temperature above or below its historical norm, but we do not obtain any statistically significant effects for changes in precipitation. We also show that the marginal effects of temperature shocks vary across climates and income groups. Our counterfactual analysis suggests that a persistent increase in average global temperature by 0.04 degrees C per year, in the absence of mitigation policies, reduces world real GDP per capita by more than 7 percent by 2100. On the other hand, abiding by the Paris Agreement goals, thereby limiting the temperature increase to 0.01 degrees C per annum, reduces the loss substantially to about 1 percent. These effects vary significantly across countries depending on the pace of temperature increases and variability of climate conditions. The estimated losses would increase to 13 percent globally if country-specific variability of climate conditions were to rise commensurate with annual temperature increases of 0.04 degrees C."
10.1007/s11356-022-22312-5,"This paper analyzes the effect of certain factors on electricity consumption in Spain at a sectoral level. An electricity consumption function has been estimated by using panel data, depending on gross value added (GVA), temperatures, capitalization, and human capital. This function is obtained for total productive electricity consumption and for the agricultural, construction, industrial, service, and public administration sectors, referring to the 17 Autonomous Communities of Spain for the 2000-2013 period. The obtained results show important sectoral differences in the effect that GVA has on electricity consumption, indicating a positive and increasing effect of temperatures above 22 degrees C in the total economy and in the tertiary sector, and a negative effect of temperatures below 18 degrees C in some sectors. These results may indicate that global warming may induce an electricity demand growth in Spain, especially related to cooling needs. The results also highlight the positive effects of capitalization in all sectors, and the negative effects of human capital, except for the public administration sector. In this context, it may be appropriate to carry out policies that mitigate this consumption growth, reinforcing energy efficiency measures, and human capital investments."
10.1002/ijfe.2952,"This work explores the role of weather shocks, measured as temperature deviations from their normal, in affecting GDP growth through a panel of 148 countries, spanning the period 1960-2019 and a panel quantile approach. The findings show that GDP growth is negatively affected by such deviations at higher quantiles, with the results receiving robust support from three alternative methodologies. The analysis also identifies two channels through which the findings receive further support, such as, the 'heat-exposed' sectors effect on labour productivity, and the impact of temperature deviations on the capital accumulation capacity. The results also survive the role of the country development status. Finally, the analysis identifies the role of the countries' geographical location. The results can have substantial merit for policymakers in terms of the role of climate conditions in the growth process, especially in poor countries."
10.1007/s10584-022-03387-y,"Quantifying which nations are culpable for the economic impacts of anthropogenic warming is central to informing climate litigation and restitution claims for climate damages. However, for countries seeking legal redress, the magnitude of economic losses from warming attributable to individual emitters is not known, undermining their standing for climate liability claims. Uncertainties compound at each step from emissions to global greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations, GHG concentrations to global temperature changes, global temperature changes to country-level temperature changes, and country-level temperature changes to economic losses, providing emitters with plausible deniability for damage claims. Here we lift that veil of deniability, combining historical data with climate models of varying complexity in an integrated framework to quantify each nation's culpability for historical temperature-driven income changes in every other country. We find that the top five emitters (the United States, China, Russia, Brazil, and India) have collectively caused US$6 trillion in income losses from warming since 1990, comparable to 14% of annual global gross domestic product; many other countries are responsible for billions in losses. Yet the distribution of warming impacts from emitters is highly unequal: high-income, high-emitting countries have benefited themselves while harming low-income, low-emitting countries, emphasizing the inequities embedded in the causes and consequences of historical warming. By linking individual emitters to country-level income losses from warming, our results provide critical insight into climate liability and national accountability for climate policy."
10.1016/j.jag.2024.104086,"The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita is one of the most widely used socioeconomic indicators, serving as an integral component for climate change impact analysis. However, a national scale assessment may induce considerable bias because it conceals any internal variations within a country. The lack of a long-term sub-national scale GDP data is a substantive hinderance. Leveraging the close relationship between nighttime lights and GDP, we address this gap by developing a novel methodological framework in two steps. First, under the modeling philosophy of spatial statistics, we developed a novel approach based on deep and machine learning techniques to establish a complex mapping between two inconsistent nighttime lights (NTL) datasets: the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP) and the National Polar-Orbiting Partnership's Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). The models achieve accuracies ranging from 0.945 to 0.980 (correlation coefficients). By taking the estimations ensemble of the two techniques, the time series of DMSP data was extended to 2021. Next, a novel modeling strategy based on multi-layer perceptron was developed to derive the non-linear relationship between NTL and GDP per capita at sub-national scale to alleviate scale effects at this granularity, while explicitly capturing regional heterogeneity effect. The trained models achieve average accuracies of 0.967, 0.959, and 0.959 on the training, validation, and test sets, respectively. We evaluate the developed dataset at the global, national, and sub-national scales from various perspective, and the results offer solid evidence on the reliability of the estimated economic data. By linking to historical global climate change data, we quantify global economic losses attributed to extreme heat to demonstrate how the estimated GDP data can be useful in the climate change impact analysis."
10.1098/rsta.2016.0460,"Empirical evidence suggests that Variations in climate affect economic growth across countries over time. However, little is known about the relative impacts of climate change on economic outcomes when global mean surface temperature (GMST) is stabilized at 1.5 degrees C or 2 degrees C warming relative to pre-industrial levels. Here We use a new set of climate simulations under 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C. warming from the 'Half a degree Additional warming, Prognosis and Projected Impacts' (HAPPI) project to assess changes in economic growth using empirical estimates of climate impacts in a global panel dataset. Panel estimation results that are robust to outliers and breaks suggest that within-year variability of monthly temperatures and precipitation has little effect on economic growth beyond global nonlinear temperature effects. While expected temperature changes under a GMST increase of 1.5 degrees C lead to proportionally higher warming in the Northern Hemisphere, the projected impact on economic growth is larger in the Tropics and Southern Hemisphere. Accounting for econometric estimation and climate uncertainty, the projected impacts on economic growth of 1.5 degrees C warming are close to indistinguishable from current climate conditions, while 2 degrees C warming suggests statistically lower economic growth for a large set of countries (median projected annual growth up to 2% lower). Level projections of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita exhibit high uncertainties, with median projected global average GDP per capita approximately 5% lower at the end of the century under 2 degrees C warming relative to 1.5 degrees C. The correlation between climate-induced reductions in per capita GDP growth and national income levels is significant at the p < 0.001 level, with lower-income countries experiencing greater losses, which may increase economic inequality between countries and is relevant to discussions of loss and damage under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

10.1016/j.eneco.2024.107758,"We examine the effect of rising temperatures on regional economic development, using annual sub-national data for over 1500 regions in 152 countries between 1990 and 2017. In a panel setting with region- and country-year fixed effects, we find no evidence of a homogeneous or heterogeneous effect of rising temperatures on economic development as measured by regional per capita income. Additionally, we find no non-linear relationship between temperature and economic development. We also employ a long-difference approach that is attuned to exploring the long-run relationship between rising temperatures and regional income. Results indicate that rising temperatures have a negative long-run impact on regional per capita income for a minority of regions located in countries with weak economic, legal and political institutions. Furthermore, these vulnerable regions experience a decline in long-term population and human capital development. The use of alternative regional per capita GDP data from 1950 onwards yields similar empirical results. Our findings suggest that negative economic effects of temperature increase with time, only becoming apparent in the long run for regions in already disadvantaged countries. Thus, country-specific conditions may moderate regional economic vulnerability to future temperature increases due to global climate change."

This paper attempts to verify if there is climatic change in Sub-Saharan Africa with the help of monthly station data from January 1901 to December 2020 on the mean temperatures of 48 countries of Sub-Saharan Africa. To do this, we employ fractional integration to account for the data's probable long memory feature. However, because other statistical features such as linear trends and seasonality might also be present in the data, we propose a broad framework that treats these three characteristics (long-range dependence, time trends, and seasonality) in a unified treatment. We first note that long memory is an observed feature in the data and using the original data, the time trends are found to be significant in Southern and Eastern countries, with higher coefficients being observed when the post -War II data are employed. When looking at the anomalies with respect to selected periods, long memory is found in all cases, and a higher number of trends are detected. Thus, 41 countries show significant time trends, with the values being higher again in the post WW2 sample, suggesting that industrialization might have contributed to global warming. The results also indicate some degree of heterogeneity across the African countries."

Nevertheless, trade activities are vulnerable to changing climate patterns. This research investigates the repercussions of extreme weather events induced by climate change on trade activities in 12 major ports, across 9 coastal states in India from January 2014 to March 2023. Employing panel data, we identify inverse relationships between weather variables, encompassing precipitation and relative humidity, and port traffic. In addition to weather variables, household income, air traffic, and the average net load of goods trains are used as explanatory variables of port traffic. The findings suggest that the escalation and frequence of extreme weather events can significantly impact the movement of goods and trade through ports. The detrimental impact of precipitation was particularly noticeable both on the eastern and western coasts of India, whereas relative humidity affected only the western coasts. The effect of wind speed, albeit statistically insignificant, was found to be negatively related to port flows on the eastern coast. India's status as a climate change hotspot increases the vulnerability of its ports. The methods and results presented here can inform policymakers in prioritizing training, updating insurance policies, upgrading infrastructure, and fostering stakeholder collaboration, along with the implementation of green solutions, to mitigate climate impacts."

Climate finance is the most useful tool for combating climate challenges worldwide. The study explores the present picture of climate finance in South Asian (SA) countries. The study uses multilateral development bank (MDB), Green Climate Fund (GCF), and Germanwatch supplied data from 2011 to 2021. Under the theoretical lens of institutional capacity development, the study attempts to correlate climate finance and climate risk. The study indicates an increasing trend of MBDs' and the GCF's climate finance in many countries worldwide. The study finds that MDBs' total global climate finance is USD 446,977 million, while the SA region has received USD 59,301 million since 2011. It also reports that MDBs provide 77% and 23% of the money to the mitigation and adaptation areas. Moreover, the study reports that, after COVID-19, MDBs substantially increased the amount of global climate financing, but this increase was not seen in the SA region. Our climate risk data indicate that most of the SA countries are highly long-term climate risky and lose, on average, 0.378% of GDP. The correlation matrix finds a negative and significant correlation between climate finance and long-term and yearly climate risk. The study identifies that the region's climate financing flow of money is not rationally distributed based on the short-run and long-run climate risks. The study presumes that more climate finance would be the most effective mechanism to mitigate climate risk. Therefore, SA region leadership drastically requires a holistic framework to address the prevailing climate problems and to ensure regional coordination and cooperation toward climate finance and policies. The research findings have significant implications for climate policy and climate finance."
10.1038/s41586-024-08020-9,"Global emission reduction efforts continue to be insufficient to meet the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement1. This makes the systematic exploration of so-called overshoot pathways that temporarily exceed a targeted global warming limit before drawing temperatures back down to safer levels a priority for science and policy2-5. Here we show that global and regional climate change and associated risks after an overshoot are different from a world that avoids it. We find that achieving declining global temperatures can limit long-term climate risks compared with a mere stabilization of global warming, including for sea-level rise and cryosphere changes. However, the possibility that global warming could be reversed many decades into the future might be of limited relevance for adaptation planning today. Temperature reversal could be undercut by strong Earth-system feedbacks resulting in high near-term and continuous long-term warming6,7. To hedge and protect against high-risk outcomes, we identify the geophysical need for a preventive carbon dioxide removal capacity of several hundred gigatonnes. Yet, technical, economic and sustainability considerations may limit the realization of carbon dioxide removal deployment at such scales8,9. Therefore, we cannot be confident that temperature decline after overshoot is achievable within the timescales expected today. Only rapid near-term emission reductions are effective in reducing climate risks. Aiming for declining global temperatures can limit long-term climate risks compared with a mere stabilization of global warming, including sea-level rise and cryosphere changes."
10.1016/j.fmre.2022.03.010,"Global climate governance has entered the era of carbon neutrality, as a growing number of countries have set the goal of carbon neutrality for long-term emissions reduction toward the mid-21st century. In 2020, China also pledged itself to the goal of carbon neutrality, which creates an urgent demand for this country to establish a systematic and integrated national climate governance system. Against this background, this paper conducts a systematic literature review of climate governance systems from the perspectives of top-level design and the governance paradigm to bring insights into climate governance toward carbon neutrality. The results show that although there are interactions between decarbonization and other environmental, social and economic fields, research gaps still exist when enhancing climate governance toward carbon neutrality. For example, issues regarding incorporating climate factors into the overall economic and social layout, strengthening the capacity of data collection relevant to climate adaptation, integrating climate mitigation and adaption actions, as well as connecting domestic climate governance and international cooperation, need to be further addressed. In addition, within the national governance system, studies combining both regional and sectoral concerns and the intertemporal dynamic allocation mechanism need to be further addressed when China decomposes its national climate target. Moreover, the division of power between the central government and local government, as well as the communication scheme between government and non-state actors, also turns out to be important for effective governance. Based on this analysis, policy implications are further proposed for China's formulation and implementation of long-term strategies of climate governance toward carbon neutrality."

10.1007/s10584-021-02974-9,"Individuals living in every region of the world are increasingly vulnerable to negative health outcomes due to extreme heat exposure. Children, in particular, may face long-term consequences associated with heat stress that affect their educational attainment and later life health and well-being. Retrospective individual-level analyses are useful for determining the effects of extreme heat exposure on health outcomes. Typically, future risk is inferred by extrapolating these effects using future warming scenarios that are applied uniformly over space and time without consideration of topographical or climatological gradients. We propose an alternative approach using a stochastic weather generator. This approach employs a 1 degrees C warming scenario to produce an ensemble of plausible future weather scenarios, and subsequently a distribution of future health risks. We focus on the effect of global warming on fetal development as measured by birth weight in Ethiopia. We demonstrate that predicted changes in birth weight are sensitive to the evolution of temperatures not quantified in a uniform warming scenario. Distributions of predicted changes in birth weight vary in magnitude and variability depending on geographic and socioeconomic region. We present these distributions alongside results from the uniform warming scenario and discuss the spatiotemporal variability of these predicted changes."

The Agreement, aiming at promoting a high-ambition, needs to enhance transparency and accountability that enables all countries to foster climate resilience and low greenhouse gas emissions development in line with the global goal to hold the increase in global average temperature below 2 degrees C, through binding rules in the core to track progress towards achieving targets. Prior to the Paris climate conference in December 2015, Taiwan has promulgated the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) as well as the Greenhouse Gas Reduction and Management Act, demonstrating Taiwan toward a new stage for not only coping with climate change issues but also fulfilling the Paris Agreement's spirit. This paper discussed the leading role of business model in green growth, and the relevant indispensable incentives for Taiwan's climate ambition. Policies should be consistent with the business models. To this end, the development of green energy technology comes with enormous business opportunities, and the industry can benefit from getting involved in early stage so as to develop affordable green technologies and maximize the design potential of a global achievement in decarbonisation in the developing world."
10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.06.022,"Previous studies have used national data to demonstrate that higher annual temperatures negatively affect economic output and growth. Yet, annual temperatures and productivity can also vary greatly across space within countries. With this in mind, we revisit the relationship between temperature and economic growth using subnational short panel data for 10,597 grid cells across the terrestrial Earth. Our estimates from fitting a quadratic model to the data imply that cell-level economic growth in countries with below-median per-capita incomes is concave in temperature, with a maximum at about 16 degrees C. Our findings suggest that even with similar economic development within a country, climate vulnerability can vary at the regional level. Furthermore, as soon as we take into account the nonlinear relationship between temperatures and economic growth within countries, the impacts of temperature increases are found to be larger, compared to those that disregard such within-country heterogeneity."

Adverse impacts on human society include increasing water shortages and impacts on mental health. Options for solutions emerge from rethinking economic models, rights-based litigation, strengthened governance systems and a new social contract. The disruption caused by COVID-19 could be seized as an opportunity for positive change, directing economic stimulus towards sustainable investments. Technical summary. A synthesis is made of ten fields within climate science where there have been significant advances since mid-2019, through an expert elicitation process with broad disciplinary scope. Findings include: (1) a better understanding of equilibrium climate sensitivity; (2) abrupt thaw as an accelerator of carbon release from permafrost; (3) changes to global and regional land carbon sinks; (4) impacts of climate change on water crises, including equity perspectives; (5) adverse effects on mental health from climate change; (6) immediate effects on climate of the COVID-19 pandemic and requirements for recovery packages to deliver on the Paris Agreement; (7) suggested long-term changes to governance and a social contract to address climate change, learning from the current pandemic, (8) updated positive cost-benefit ratio and new perspectives on the potential for green growth in the short- and long-term perspective; (9) urban electrification as a strategy to move towards low-carbon energy systems and (10) rights-based litigation as an increasingly important method to address climate change, with recent clarifications on the legal standing and representation of future generations.

10.3389/fevo.2022.1028485,"Climate change is having profound effects on natural and socio-economic systems, especially via extreme climate events. Using panel data from 129 prefectural-level cities in China from 2013 to 2019, this paper explores the effects of extreme climate on crime rates based on a climate index and manual collection of crime data. The results showed that extreme climate has a significant positive effect on crime rates, increasing by 0.035% for every 1% increase in the extreme climate index. This occurs through two mechanistic pathways: reduced agricultural output and lower employment income. The heterogeneity analysis shows that extreme climate has a greater impact on crime rates in eastern areas which are economically developed and have high levels of immigration. This study provides new perspectives on the impact of extreme climate on the economy and society, in which governments can actively participate in climate governance through environmental protection, energy conservation and emission reduction, and technological innovation to reduce crime rates by reducing the occurrence of extreme climate."
10.1017/nie.2021.35,"Climate change and weather shocks have multi-faceted impacts on food systems with important implications for economic policy. Combining a longitudinal household survey with high-resolution climate data, we demonstrate that both climate and weather shocks increase food insecurity; cash assistance and participation in Ethiopia's Productive Safety Net Programme have reduced food insecurity; but food assistance has been ineffective. Importantly, households with savings, and those that stored their harvest to sell at higher prices rather than for home use, suffered less from food insecurity, yet both strategies are harder for the poorest and most food insecure households to adopt. Our paper provides micro-founded evidence needed to design policies that both improve agricultural yields in the context of a changing climate and target households' abilities to cope with shocks that put upwards pressure on food prices."

We analysed the projected demand for respiratory-related ICU average length of stay (in days) per capita (ICUD/C) with four historical and one future projection dataset.

The annual growth in the population density-weighted wet-bulb-globe temperature-a combined measure of temperature and humidity-is strongly correlated with the annual per capita growth ICUD/C for respiratory-related con-ditions (r=0.771; p,0.001). This relationship was applied to develop a model projecting future respiratory -related ICU demand with three possible future Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP). RCP2.6 (lowest carbon emission climate scenario) showed only a 33.4% increase in Australian ICUD/C demand by 2090, while the RCP8.5 (highest carbon emission climate scenario) demonstrated almost two-fold higher demand (66.1%) than RCP2.6 by 2090.Conclusions The annual growth in population density-weighted wet-bulb-globe temperature correlates with the annual growth in Australian ICUD/C for respiratory-related conditions. A model based on possible future climate sce-narios can be developed to predict changes in ICU demand in response to CO2 changes over the coming decades."

Efforts to combat climate change can be viewed as a large public good everyone benefits without rivalry or exclusion. Therefore, climate change policy explicates a market failure because the actions that protect against climate change are very costly, but the benefits of such actions are enjoyed by all and sundry. It is therefore imperative to understand this issue and prudent policy measures to combat climate change. This study employs a Panel VAR approach to investigate the impact of monetary policy on climate change in the East African Community (EAC). The EAC region was considered because it has been recently been considered a hotspot for climate change. The empirical evidence shows that monetary policy through the credit and interest rate channel can help smooth the transition to low-carbon economies, but at the cost of financial disruption."
10.3390/ijerph17228562,"This narrative review examined strategies for preparedness and response to mental health impacts of three forms of climate change from a services perspective: (1) acute and extreme weather events such as hurricanes, floods, and wildfires, (2) sub-acute or long-term events such as droughts and heatwaves; and (3) the prospect of long-term and permanent changes, including higher temperatures, rising sea levels, and an uninhabitable physical environment. Strategies for acute events included development and implementation of programs and practices for monitoring and treating mental health problems and strengthening individual and community resilience, training of community health workers to deliver services, and conducting inventories of available resources and assessments of at-risk populations. Additional strategies for sub-acute changes included advocacy for mitigation policies and programs and adaptation of guidelines and interventions to address the secondary impacts of sub-acute events, such as threats to livelihood, health and well-being, population displacement, environmental degradation, and civil conflict. Strategies for long-lasting changes included the implementation of evidence-based risk communication interventions that address the existing and potential threat of climate change, promoting the mental health benefits of environmental conservation, and promoting psychological growth and resilience."
10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.122083,"This study investigates climate risk and its effects on global value chain (GVC) participation, with a focus on the impact of drought on the export value-added ratio (DVAR) of Chinese manufacturing firms. Using fixed effects (FE) and system GMM models, the main findings are: Drought significantly reduces manufacturing firms' DVAR, with the lagged dependent variable showing a strong persistence effect and an even greater impact in the second lag period. This impact varies based on the firm's location, the complexity of its value chain, and its ability to adapt to and mitigate climate change effects. Strategies such as improving operational efficiency, investing in sustainable technologies, and enhancing competitiveness in developed markets may help mitigate or reverse the adverse effects of climate change on these firms. Additionally, significant industry and regional differences are observed, with the Northeast, East, and South China regions being most severely affected by drought. Global innovation value chains and regional processing value chains are significantly negatively impacted, while laborintensive value chains are affected only in the current period. These findings provide new insights into the economic impacts of climate change and offer a basis for policymakers to develop strategies that help firms adapt to and mitigate climate risks."
10.1073/pnas.2024792118,"Increased exposure to extreme heat from both climate change and the urban heat island effect-total urban warming-threatens the sustainability of rapidly growing urban settlements worldwide. Extreme heat exposure is highly unequal and severely impacts the urban poor. While previous studies have quantified global exposure to extreme heat, the lack of a globally accurate, fine-resolution temporal analysis of urban exposure crucially limits our ability to deploy adaptations. Here, we estimate daily urban population exposure to extreme heat for 13,115 urban settlements from 1983 to 2016. We harmonize global, fine-resolution (0.05 degrees), daily temperature maxima and relative humidity estimates with geolocated and longitudinal global urban population data. We measure the average annual rate of increase in exposure (person-days/year(-1)) at the global, regional, national, and municipality levels, separating the contribution to exposure trajectories from urban population growth versus total urban warming. Using a daily maximum wet bulb globe temperature threshold of 30 degrees C, global exposure increased nearly 200% from 1983 to 2016. Total urban warming elevated the annual increase in exposure by 52% compared to urban population growth alone. Exposure trajectories increased for 46% of urban settlements, which together in 2016 comprised 23% of the planet's population (1.7 billion people). However, how total urban warming and population growth drove exposure trajectories is spatially heterogeneous. This study reinforces the importance of employing multiple extreme heat exposure metrics to identify local patterns and compare exposure trends across geographies. Our results suggest that previous research underestimates extreme heat exposure, highlighting the urgency for targeted adaptations and early warning systems to reduce harm from urban extreme heat exposure."
10.1016/j.jeem.2024.102970,"Short-term weather forecasts, a common and popular public good in the modern world, affect labor decisions regarding time allocations. This study uses a novel dataset of city -level dayahead weather forecasts in China, collected through video transcriptions of the country's popular TV program spanning over 2000 days since 2010. I estimate the number of hours laborers worked in a day as flexible functions of the daily maximum temperature forecast under different historical levels of forecast accuracy (represented by half -year rolling daily maximum temperature forecast root -mean -squared -error, RMSE ). The results suggest largemagnitude (up to 4.5 and 1.2 h per day) labor decreases under uncomfortable temperature forecasts (extreme heat above 30 degrees C and medium cold 15 degrees C-25 degrees C ), but only when forecasts are accurate ( RMSE approximate to 1 degrees C ). The economic value of accurate weather forecasts is assessed by modeling this labor adaptation to forecasts. Specifically, 930 Yuan (148 USD, in 2015 currency) is gained per worker per year, with each 1 degrees C decrease in the city forecast RMSE . For the entire country, an average 3.9% increase in city -level forecast accuracy for 2011-2015 generates a considerable social benefit of 25.3 billion Yuan (4.03 billion USD) annually from the labor sector alone, nearly covering the annual cost of the national weather forecasting system."
10.1002/hec.4264,"This paper presents the first causal estimates of the effect of weather on children's time allocation. It exploits exogenous variations in local weather observed during the random diary dates of two nationally representative cohorts of Australian children whose time-use diaries were surveyed biennially over 10 years. Unfavorable weather conditions, as represented by cold or hot temperature or rain, cause children to switch activities from outdoors to indoors, mainly by reducing the time allocated to active pursuits and travel and increasing the time allocated to media. Furthermore, the effects of bad weather are more pronounced on weekends and for children with asthma. Our results also provide some evidence of adaptation, as temperature tends to have greater impact not only in winter months but also in colder regions. Our findings are robust to a wide range of sensitivity checks, including controlling for individual fixed effects and using alternative model specifications. Overall, the results suggest that extreme weather conditions may diminish children's health, development and long-term achievements through their effects on children's time allocation."

In the public debate about the fair allocation of associated costs commonly the moral claim that the developed countries should burden the costs is expressed. To support this claim, often four moral arguments, based on the theory of justice, are raised: (i) the polluter pays, (ii) the historical responsibility, (iii) the beneficiary pays, and (iv) the ability to pay. The aim of the paper is to assess whether these principles impose a duty on the developed countries and whether a fair allocation of costs would be achieved."
10.3390/cli12080110,"In rainfed areas, precipitation variations directly impact wheat growth stages such as emergence, tillering, jointing and booting, and maturity. Evaluating the impact of climate change on precipitation patterns during these critical growth stages is crucial for adapting climate change and ensuring global food security. In this study, projections of five General Circulation models (GCMs) under two shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) were used to predict the changing characteristics of precipitation during four main growth stages of wheat in the rainfed region of the Pothwar Plateau, Pakistan. Historical datasets of daily precipitation at six weather stations were analyzed to check the past changes in the precipitation patterns. During the baseline period (1985-2014), the annual average precipitation decreased at a rate of -9.75 mm/decade, while the amount of precipitation during the rabi season (wheat-growing season) decreased at a rate of -20.47 mm/decade. An increase in the precipitation was found during the fourth (flowering) stage of crop growth, while the first three stages experienced a decrease in the precipitation amount. The multimodal ensembled data, under the SSP2-4.5 scenario, revealed a significant decline (at the rate of -16.63 mm/decade) in the future annual precipitation. However, it is projected that, under SSP2-4.5, there may be a slight increase (4.03 mm/decade) in the total precipitation amount during the future rabi season. Under the SSP5-8.5 scenario, average annual precipitation exhibited a slightly increasing trend, increasing by 1.0 mm/decade. However, during the rabi season, there was a possibility of a decrease in precipitation amount, with a rate of 11.64 mm/decade. It is also expected that the precipitation amount may vary significantly during the crown root initiation, jointing and booting, and flowering stages in the near future. These results provide a framework for the planning of wheat production in the Pothwar region of Pakistan, taking into account the potential impact of shifting weather patterns, particularly in terms of uneven precipitation."
10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2016.12.006,"Climate change is threatening global food production and could potentially exacerbate food insecurity in many parts of the world. China, is the second largest maize producer. Variations in maize yields in China are likely to have major implications for food security in the world. Based on longitudinal data of 4861 households collected annually between 2004 and 2010, we assess the impact of weather variations on maize yields in the two main producing regions in China, the Northern spring maize zone and the Yellow-Huai Valley summer maize zone. We also explore the role of adaptation, by estimating the response of Chinese farmers in both regions, in particular in terms of income diversification. With the use of household and time fixed effects, our estimates relate within-household variations in household outcomes (maize yields, net income, land and input use) to within-location variations in weather conditions. Temperature, drought, wet conditions, and precipitations have detrimental effects on maize yields in the two maize zones. The impact is stronger in the Northern spring maize zone where one standard deviation in temperature and drought conditions decreases maize yields by 1.4% and 2.5%, respectively. Nonetheless, such impact does not seem to translate into a significant fall in total net income. Adaptation seems to be key in explaining such a contrast in the Northern spring maize zone where the largest impact is estimated. On the contrary, we find a lower impact in the other region, the Yellow-Huai Valley summer maize zone but such impact is likely to intensify. The lack of adaptation observed in that region results into detrimental impacts on net farm and total income. Enhancing adaptative behaviors among Chinese farmers even further is likely to be key to future food security in China and in the rest of the world. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
10.1088/1748-9326/11/6/064008,"Climate change has been statistically proven to substantially influence the economy of early modern Europe, particularly in the long term. However, a detailed analysis of climate change and the economy of historical China remains lacking, particularly from a large-scale and quantitative perspective. This study quantitatively analyzes the relationship between climate change and the economy in late imperial China (AD 1600-1840) at the national level. This study also compares the findings on the relationship between climate change and the economy in late imperial China with those in early modern Europe. Results of multivariate regression and Granger causality analyses indicate that (1) climate change induces economic fluctuations in late imperial China, particularly in the long term; (2) given that the economic center is located in South China during the study period, temperature has a greater influence on the economy than precipitation; (3) the population of China is statistically proven to primarily act as consumers in the long term; and (4) given the long-term role of the Chinese population, the economic vulnerability in late imperial China under climate change is further increased and is higher than that in early modern Europe, whose population mainly acts as producers in the long term. In conclusion, the late imperial Chinese society has a high economic vulnerability to climate change. These findings revisit Malthusian theory and 'Great Divergence' theory by including the perspective of economic vulnerability under climate change during the study period. The role of the population must be investigated further to address the socioeconomic vulnerabilities under climate change."
10.1016/j.jeem.2024.103047,"This paper improves our understanding of how rainwater impacts economic growth by investigating the effects of overlooked properties of the water cycle. First, we consider the natural separation of rainwater into flows of blue water (i.e., the water that runs off towards rivers) and green water (i.e., that remaining in the soil). Second, we account for the presence of surface and groundwater stocks. . These considerations allow us to comprehensively address the whole partition of rainwater, which, upon reaching the ground, splits into distinct water resources that determine water availability inland. Our analyses on a global panel coupling sub-national economic and hydrological data show that rainwater does increase growth, but do so differently depending on its partition. Specifically, blue water leads to more economic growth than green water at the margin, but, because two thirds of terrestrial water is green, the latter contributes more to growth in total. By missing this crucial partition, we find that commonly used rainwater measurements overstate rainwater's contribution to growth (by about two). Our analyses further indicate that, although groundwater reserves always mitigate the impacts of rainwater reduction on growth, surface water reserves sometimes amplify regional dependence to rainwater (depending on sector, income and reserve types)."
10.1016/j.irfa.2024.103096,"There is a growing awareness that climate change is a new source of risk to the financial system, but crosscountry evidence on the impact of climate risk on financial stability is lacking. This study empirically investigates the impact of climate risk on financial stability using panel data from 2007 to 2019 in 53 countries. The findings of this study reveal that climate risk negatively affects financial stability, and this adverse impact will show differences due to the different levels of economic development, financial development, and competition among countries. Furthermore, macroprudential policies have effectively maintained the financial stability of countries affected by climate risk. However, the macroprudential policies imposed on borrowers are different from balance -based and buffer -based macroprudential tools. In addition, good national governance quality can contain the impact of climate risk on financial stability. After suffering from climate risk, strengthening political stability, improving government efficiency, supervision, and legal system, strictly controlling corruption and improving the right to speak and accountability are conducive to the country's maintenance of financial stability to varying degrees. This study not only enriches the existing research in the field of climate financial risk, but also provides a reference for government departments to reduce the impact of climate risk and maintain financial stability."
10.1088/1748-9326/abc587,"The importance of green water (moisture from rain stored in soils) for global food and water security is widely recognized, with process-based simulation models and field-level studies demonstrating its role in supporting rainfed agriculture. Despite this evidence, the relationship between green water anomalies and rainfed agriculture has not yet been investigated using statistical models that identify a causal relationship between the variables. Here, we address this gap and use disaggregated statistical regression (panel data analysis) at the 30 arc-min grid level to study the response of observed yields (1982-2010) of four main crops (maize, rice, soybean and wheat) to green water anomalies globally over rainfed areas. Dry green water anomalies (1 or 2 standard deviations below long-term average) decrease rainfed crop yields worldwide. This effect is more pronounced for wheat and maize, whose yields decline by 12%-18% and 7%-12% respectively. Globally, agricultural production benefits from wet green water anomalies. This effect is intensified in arid climates and weakened in humid climates where, for wheat, soybean and rice, periods of green water availability 2 standard deviations above long-term averages lead to declines in crop yield. This confirms existing evidence that excess soil moisture is detrimental to crop yield. These findings (1) advance our understanding of the impact of green water on rainfed food production and (2) provide empirical evidence supporting arguments for better management of local green water resources to reduce the impact of agricultural drought and waterlogging on rainfed crop production and capture the yield increasing effects of positive green water anomalies."
10.1016/j.jcomm.2024.100423,"The challenges posed by climate change on the agricultural market have become a pressing concern. An accurate reading of future agricultural commodity prices can be an invaluable planning instrument for diverse interested parties. Here, we explore asset pricing implications of climate risk for the agricultural commodity market from January 2005 to December 2021. Through introducing a composite climate risk index based on the four individual climate risk measures of Faccini et al. (2023), our findings provide valuable insights into the time-series predictability of aggregate climate risk on future agricultural commodity returns, both in- and out-of-sample. This powerful predictability conveys substantial economic benefits to mean- variance investors and cannot be subsumed by conventional economic predictor variables. The evidence further suggests that physical risk, especially global warming, exhibits much stronger return predictability than transition risk. Moreover, we emphasize the pivotal role of climate risk in shaping supply dynamics and capturing investor attention, thereby serving as potential drivers of return predictability. Overall, these predictive insights hold important implications for risk management, investment strategies, and policy formulation in the agricultural commodity market."
10.1007/s10584-005-5929-9,"This paper discusses methodological issues relevant to the calculation of historical responsibility of countries for climate change ('The Brazilian Proposal'). Using a simple representation of the climate system, the paper compares contributions to climate change using different indicators: current radiative forcing, current GWP-weighted emissions, radiative forcing from increased concentrations, cumulative GWP-weighted emissions, global-average surface-air temperature increase and two new indicators: weighted concentrations (analogue to GWP-weighted emissions) and integrated temperature increase. Only the last two indicators are at the same time 'backward looking' (take into account historical emissions), 'backward discounting' (early emissions weigh less, depending on the decay in the atmosphere) and 'forward looking' (future effects of the emissions are considered) and are comparable for all gases. Cumulative GWP-weighted emissions are simple to calculate but are not 'backward discounting'. 'Radiative forcing' and 'temperature increase' are not 'forward looking'. 'Temperature increase' discounts the emissions of the last decade due to the slow response of the climate system. It therefore gives low weight to regions that have recently significantly increased emissions. Results of the five different indicators are quite similar for large groups (but possibly not for individual countries): industrialized countries contributed around 60% to today's climate change, developing countries around 40% (using the available data for fossil, industrial and forestry CO2, CH4 and N2O). The paper further argues including non-linearities of the climate system or using a simplified linear system is a political choice. The paper also notes that results of contributions to climate change need to be interpreted with care: Countries that developed early benefited economically, but have high historical emission, and countries developing at a later period can profit from developments in other countries and are therefore likely to have a lower contribution to climate change."
10.7717/peerj.8026,"China has experienced intensive urbanization over the past decades. However, it is still unclear about the influence of urbanization on urban thermal comfort and how the effect varies with climate condition. Based on long-term daily meteorological data from 1990 to 2015 in four Chinese cities undergoing rapid urbanization, our study tried to detect the long-term dynamics of summer urban thermal comfort across different climate zones and analyze their relationships with urbanization. Our results showed that urbanization can increase urban temperature and decrease relative humidity and wind velocity. Urban thermal comfort and discomfort days also changed greatly, especially in Harbin, Northeast China from 1990 to 2015. However, such changes for different cities across different climate zones are inconsistent. Results also showed that urbanization especially for social economic activities can have a significant influence on the physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET). Compared with southern cities, the PET in northern cities such as Harbin and Changchun in this study is more sensitive to urbanization. These results reveal that the changing patterns of urban thermal comfort in Chinese cities under rapid urbanization, and help government take some effective measures to improve urban thermal environment."
10.1146/annurev-resource-100516-033554,"This article reviews the economic and analytical challenges of adaptation to climate change. Adaptation to climate risks that can no longer be avoided is an important aspect of the global response to climate change. Humans have always adapted to changing climatic conditions, and there is growing, if still patchy, evidence of widespread adaptation behavior. However, adaptation is not autonomous as sometimes claimed. It requires knowledge, planning, coordination, and foresight. There are important knowledge gaps, behavioral barriers, and market failures that hold back effective adaptation and require policy intervention. We identify the most urgent adaptation priorities, including areas where delay might lock in future vulnerability, and outline the decision-making challenges of adapting to an unknown future climate. We also highlight the strong interlinkages between adaptation and economic development, pointing out that decisions on industrial strategy, urban planning, and infrastructure investment all have a strong bearing on future vulnerability to climate change. We review the implications of these links for adaptation finance and what the literature tells us about the balance between adaptation and mitigation."
10.1016/j.cities.2024.105456,"Extreme temperature can worsen the sustainability of government finance, and is a public cost that needs to be identified. In this paper, we estimate the impact of high temperatures on spreads of Urban Investment Bond (UIB) by dividing daily mean temperatures obtained from weather stations into ten temperature bins and calculating the number of days in a year that fall into different temperature bins and matching them with China's bond-level data of UIBs. We find that an increase in extreme temperatures results in a significant rise in the yield spreads of UIBs. This is because extreme temperatures weaken the guarantee capacity of local governments as well as increase their demand for financing through UIBs. A series of robustness verify the robustness of the results. In further analysis, we explore the effect of investors' attention, mitigation and adaptation measures, heterogeneity and predicts the long-term impacts of temperature change. This paper enriches the literature on the impacts of climate change on the public sector, on the pricing of municipal bonds, on the impacts of climate change on developing countries, and provides credible policy implications for bond management and fiscal sustainability of local governments."
10.1016/j.eneco.2021.105216,"Previous research on the effects of daylight saving time (DST) on electricity consumption has provided mixed results.

This provides us with a unique opportunity to study the interaction effects of DST with exogenous variation in daily weather conditions and cooling usage over two decades. Our results show that the effect of DST on electricity consumption depends strongly on weather conditions and cooling usage. Forward DST increases the electricity consumption when temperatures and air conditioner ownership are higher.

10.1016/j.gfs.2020.100488,"The potential impacts of climate change on current livestock systems worldwide are a major concern, and yet the topic is covered to a limited extent in global reports such as the ones produced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In this article, we review the risk of climate-related impacts along the land-based livestock food supply chain. Although a quantification of the net impacts of climate change on the livestock sector is beyond the reach of our current understanding, there is strong evidence that there will be impacts throughout the supply chain, from farm production to processing operations, storage, transport, retailing and human consumption. The risks of climate-related impacts are highly context-specific but expected to be higher in environments that are already hot and have limited socio-economic and institutional resources for adaptation. Large uncertainties remain as to climate futures and the exposure and responses of the interlinked human and natural systems to climatic changes over time. Consequently, adaptation choices will need to account for a wide range of possible futures, including those with low probability but large consequences."
10.1016/j.compag.2023.108335,"There are great challenges for the accurate prediction of wheat yield at large-scale region due to the spatial heterogeneity of soil, management and meteorological conditions. The Huang-Huai-Hai plain (HHHP) is the most important wheat producing area in China. Timely and effective prediction of wheat yield in the HHHP is of great significance for ensuring food security. However, there is still a lack of studies on long-term wheat yield pre-diction with high spatial resolution in the HHHP. In this study, the simulation results (including phenological information, LAI and yield) of WheatGrow model and the meteorological variables were used to train regression model, which was applied in the corresponding satellite images and gridded meteorological variables to develop wheat yield prediction model (SCYMvp). Then time-series yield maps of wheat in the HHHP (2001-2020) were obtained and the digitization footprint was estimated. We found that SCYMvp model developed by combining machine learning algorithm (ML) with two state variables (phenological information and GCVI) had the best performance (r = 0.7, NRMSE = 15 %) for wheat yield prediction in the HHHP. Compared with other yield prediction models, SCYMvp model reduced the error of yield prediction to some extent. Meanwhile, SCYMvp model showed good accuracy in wheat yield prediction at the irrigated fields and rainfed fields. In addition, extreme climate events had a weak influence on the SCYMvp model in wheat yield prediction. The yield pre-diction with high spatial resolution generated by SCYMvp model in the HHHP during past 20 years had good consistency and low error with the statistical yield in the spatio-temporal scale. Compared with the Global-WheatYield4km product, the SCYMvp model had a better ability to capture spatial heterogeneity of wheat yield at site scale. In addition, required data size per hectare for predicting wheat yield showed a significant increasing trend. The results indicated that the SCYMvp model developed in this study can effectively map wheat yield with high spatial resolution in the study area, and has good potential in smallholder farming economy with large spatial heterogeneity of management conditions."
10.1038/s41586-018-0071-9,"International climate change agreements typically specify global warming thresholds as policy targets(1), but the relative economic benefits of achieving these temperature targets remain poorly understood(2,3). Uncertainties include the spatial pattern of temperature change, how global and regional economic output will respond to these changes in temperature, and the willingness of societies to trade present for future consumption. Here we combine historical evidence(4) with national-level climate(5) and socioeconomic(6) projections to quantify the economic damages associated with the United Nations (UN) targets of 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C global warming, and those associated with current UN national-level mitigation commitments (which together approach 3 degrees C warming(7)). We find that by the end of this century, there is a more than 75% chance that limiting warming to 1.5 degrees C would reduce economic damages relative to 2 degrees C, and a more than 60% chance that the accumulated global benefits will exceed US$20 trillion under a 3% discount rate (2010 US dollars). We also estimate that 71% of countries-representing 90% of the global population-have a more than 75% chance of experiencing reduced economic damages at 1.5 degrees C, with poorer countries benefiting most. Our results could understate the benefits of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees C if unprecedented extreme outcomes, such as large-scale sea level rise(8), occur for warming of 2 degrees C but not for warming of 1.5 degrees C. Inclusion of other unquantified sources of uncertainty, such as uncertainty in secular growth rates beyond that contained in existing socioeconomic scenarios, could also result in less precise impact estimates. We find considerably greater reductions in global economic output beyond 2 degrees C. Relative to a world that did not warm beyond 2000-2010 levels, we project 15%-25% reductions in per capita output by 2100 for the 2.5-3 degrees C of global warming implied by current national commitments(7), and reductions of more than 30% for 4 degrees C warming. Our results therefore suggest that achieving the 1.5 degrees C target is likely to reduce aggregate damages and lessen global inequality, and that failing to meet the 2 degrees C target is likely to increase economic damages substantially."
10.1002/soej.12433,"For three decades, advocates for climate change policy have simultaneously emphasized the urgency of taking ambitious actions to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and provided false reassurances of the feasibility of doing so. The policy prescription has relied almost exclusively on a single approach: reduce emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other GHGs. Since 1990, global CO2 emissions have increased 60%, atmospheric CO2 concentrations have raced past 400 ppm, and temperatures increased at an accelerating rate. The one-prong strategy has not worked. After reviewing emission mitigation's poor performance and low-probability of delivering on long-term climate goals, we advance a three-pronged strategy for mitigating climate change risks: adding adaptation and amelioration-through solar radiation management (SRM)-to the emission mitigation approach. We highlight SRM's potential, at dramatically lower cost than emission mitigation, to play a key role in offsetting warming. We address the moral hazard reservation held by environmental advocates-that SRM would diminish emission mitigation incentives-and posit that SRM deployment might even serve as an awful action alert that galvanizes more ambitious emission mitigation. We conclude by emphasizing the value of an iterative act-learn-act policy framework that engages all three prongs for limiting climate change damages."
10.3390/en12244644,"This study aims to explore the casual relationship between agricultural production, economic growth and carbon dioxide emissions in Pakistan. An autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model is applied to examine the relationship between agricultural production, economic growth and carbon dioxide emissions using time series data from 1960 to 2014. The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF), Phillips-Perron (PP) and Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) tests are used to check the stationarity of variables. The results show both short-run and long-run relationships between agricultural production, gross domestic product (GDP) and carbon dioxide emissions in Pakistan. From the short-run estimates, it is found that a 1% increase in barley and sorghum production will decrease carbon dioxide emissions by 3% and 4%, respectively. The pairwise Granger causality test shows unidirectional causality of cotton, milled rice, and sorghum production with carbon dioxide emissions. Due to the aforementioned cause, it is essential to manage the effects of carbon dioxide emissions on agricultural production. Appropriate steps are needed to develop agricultural adaptation policies, improve irrigation facilities and introduce high-yielding and disease-resistant varieties of crops to ensure food security in the country."

The scenarios describe plausible external, long-term conditions with the aim to improve the knowledge basis of a national (Norwegian) government pursuing climate policy targets for 2030 and 2050 under uncertainty. The scenario process has two phases with quite different roles for the participants. In the first, the aim is to create broad engagement and participation in exploring narratives for how key external conditions might develop and form premises for the national climate strategies for Norway. The ambition in this phase is to deduce a handful of wide-ranging and distinctly different, qualitative scenarios. The second phase is devoted to translating the narratives into quantitative projections for the Norwegian economy and greenhouse gas emissions by means of linking global and national largescale models. We claim that research projects building and using scenarios have significant potential to benefit from involving a broad stakeholder group in developing qualitative narratives. The second phase involves complex quantitative simulations. In order to provide scientific rigor and credibility to the scenarios, this phase primarily calls for scholars with technical skills, knowledge on the research frontier and modelling experience. Nevertheless, later use of these scenarios in numerical policy studies can gain from resumed researcher-stakeholder interaction."
10.1088/1748-9326/ac5cf4,"Large-ensemble climate model simulations can provide deeper understanding of the characteristics and causes of extreme events than historical observations, due to their larger sample size. However, adequate evaluation of simulated 'unseen' events that are more extreme than those seen in historical records is complicated by observational uncertainties and natural variability. Consequently, conventional evaluation and correction methods cannot determine whether simulations outside observed variability are correct for the right physical reasons. Here, we introduce a three-step procedure to assess the realism of simulated extreme events based on the model properties (step 1), statistical features (step 2), and physical credibility of the extreme events (step 3). We illustrate these steps for a 2000 year Amazon monthly flood ensemble simulated by the global climate model EC-Earth and global hydrological model PCR-GLOBWB. EC-Earth and PCR-GLOBWB are adequate for large-scale catchments like the Amazon, and have simulated 'unseen' monthly floods far outside observed variability. We find that the realism of these simulations cannot be statistically explained. For example, there could be legitimate discrepancies between simulations and observations resulting from infrequent temporal compounding of multiple flood peaks, rarely seen in observations. Physical credibility checks are crucial to assessing their realism and show that the unseen Amazon monthly floods were generated by an unrealistic bias correction of precipitation. We conclude that there is high sensitivity of simulations outside observed variability to the bias correction method, and that physical credibility checks are crucial to understanding what is driving the simulated extreme events. Understanding the driving mechanisms of unseen events may guide future research by uncovering key climate model deficiencies. They may also play a vital role in helping decision makers to anticipate unseen impacts by detecting plausible drivers."
10.1007/s11430-023-1443-0,"Economic feasibility is crucial for achieving the carbon neutrality target. However, current integrated assessments often underestimate the economic impacts of mitigation policies due to the lack of consideration of their economic benefits. This study integrates a warming-labour productivity model with a typical integrated assessment model using shared socioeconomic pathways. It simulates China's economic development and carbon emission levels under both baseline and carbon-neutral policy scenarios, evaluating the economic costs and benefits of emission reduction policies aimed at achieving carbon neutrality. These findings reveal the following: (1) The economic costs of emission reduction policies are projected to peak between 2050 and 2060, ranging from 0.41% to 9.37% of total GDP in the baseline scenario, primarily due to increased energy prices and R&D investments. These costs are expected to decline rapidly after 2070. (2) China's carbon-neutral policies will mitigate global warming, with the economic benefits of mitigation projected to reach 5.65% to 17.24% of China's total GDP by 2100. (3) Low-carbon scenarios SSP1 and SSP4 could significantly reduce initial economic costs and advance the onset of net economic gains to 2060. This integrated assessment confirms that China's carbon neutrality target offers substantial net economic benefits in the long term. To minimize initial economic costs, efforts should focus on enhancing consumption-side transitions, upgrading low-carbon technologies, and adopting new energy sources."
10.3389/fenvs.2022.996515,"In this study, we examine the contribution of nuclear, fossil (coal, oil, and gas), and renewable (hydro, solar, wind, biofuel) electricity sources to pollution in the globalization era, as measured by total greenhouse gases (GHG) produced by electricity per capita. We conduct an empirical investigation in a global panel of 163 countries which assesses both the concurrent and individual effects of alternative energy sources. Additionally, we implement a second model to assess the roles of various electricity sources on the carbon intensity of electricity generation. Robust GMM estimators show that fossil electricity is a major polluter and a driver of carbon intensity. Furthermore, nuclear and renewable energy reduce pollution on a global scale, with wind emerging as the most efficient energy source in the global fight against pollution and climate change. Moreover, globalization as measured by trade openness tends to reduce the carbon intensity of electricity production (CI), whereas biofuels have an increasing impact on CI. The findings have important policy implications, indicating that shifting to nuclear and renewable energy sources could help countries achieve their sustainable development goals more efficiently."
10.1111/rode.13135,"In recent years, there have been calls for policy makers to do more to fight climate change. Indeed, there are growing concerns that climate could exert a serious detrimental impact on financial stability, and thus the wider economy. Empirically, a limited number of studies have highlighted the inflationary effects of climate-related variables. This study is an attempt to contribute to this literature. More specifically, the article investigates the dynamic inflationary effect of climate in a case study of Belize. Results derived from quarterly data, over the period 1994-2019, and local linear projections suggest that inflation responds positively and significantly to temperature and rainfall shocks. Further disaggregation of inflation into its subindices reveals that this increase in inflation is mainly driven by the effect of climate on food, alcohol and tobacco, household, hospitality, and other goods and services inflation. The findings remain robust even when accounting for temperature and rainfall deviations from historical means. The results suggest that, while inflation control might not be a core element of monetary policy in Belize, policy makers should be aware that these climate-related effects may have ramifications for the Belize economy."

Based on Probit model regression and mediation effect tests, the following conclusions were drawn: Firstly, climate change, especially abnormal fluctuations in precipitation, triggers yield losses and induces loss aversion among herding households, which translates into agricultural insurance purchasing behavior. Secondly, as herding households are divided into production herding households and subsistence herding households, the impact of climate risk on production herding households' agricultural insurance purchase decisions is more pronounced than that of subsistence herding households. Thirdly, from the perspective of the mechanism of climate change on the agricultural insurance purchasing behavior of production-oriented herding households, climate risk mainly influences herding households' agricultural insurance purchase through their risk perception. Therefore, with the intensification of global climate change, while further stimulating the agricultural insurance purchasing demand of living herding households through differentiated premium subsidy policies in the future, it is necessary to further enhance the risk perception level of herding households by strengthening the construction of weather forecasting and agricultural and livestock risk data sharing platform, so as to transform the external changes in climate risk into the intrinsic motivation of herding households' agricultural insurance purchasing behaviors, and to enhance the herding households' Climate risk coping capacity of herdsmen."
10.3390/su11236783,"The recent IPCC Special Report on global warming of 1.5 degrees C emphasizes that rapid action to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is vital to achieving the climate mitigation goals of the Paris Agreement. The most-needed substantial upscaling of investments in GHG mitigation options in all sectors, and particularly in manufacturing sectors, can be an opportunity for a green economic development leap in developing countries. Here, we use the Brazilian manufacturing sectors as an example to explore a transformation of its economy while contributing to the Paris targets. Projections of Brazil's economic futures with and without a portfolio of fiscal policies to induce low carbon investments are produced up to 2030 (end year of Brazil's Nationally Determined Contribution-NDC), by employing the large-scale macro econometric Energy-Environment-Economy Model, E3ME. Our findings highlight that the correct mix of green stimulus can help modernize and decarbonize the Brazilian manufacturing sectors and allow the country's economy to grow faster (by up to 0.42% compared to baseline) while its carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions decline (by up to 14.5% in relation to baseline). Investment levels increase, thereby strengthening exports' competitiveness and alleviating external constraints to long-term economic growth in net terms."
10.1016/j.eneco.2024.107696,"In recent years, heightened global attention to climate change threats has spurred a rising tide of investors towards eco-conscious investment alternatives, reflecting a persistent urgency to align financial activities with sustainability objectives. This paper examines the potential role of people ' s attention to climate change concerns in explaining the price dynamics of various environmentally friendly financial assets, including solar energy stocks, clean energy stocks, sustainable stocks, low-carbon footprint stocks, and green bonds. The sample period is from January 03, 2014 to March 08, 2024. The principal component analysis is used to construct a proxy indicator for climate change-related attention, while the quantile ARDL approach is adopted to assess the relevance of this attention not only across short- and long-term horizons but also amidst normal, bearish, and bullish market conditions. The results reveal that eco-friendly financial assets are sensitive to public focus on climate change in the short run. The observed sensitivity, nonetheless, tends to fade away over the long term. For most assets examined, the magnitude of this sensitivity is not symmetric across quantiles; rather, it appears to vary depending on the prevailing market states. Our findings bear important implications for both investors and policymakers."
10.1016/j.eneco.2024.107968,"Climate policy uncertainty (CPU), driven by the need to address climate extremes and environmental degradation, significantly impacts the strategic corporate investments (CI) of energy firms. This study examines the influence of CPU on CI within the energy sector, with a particular focus on the moderating role of corporate social responsibility (CSR). Utilizing an empirical approach and a dataset of U.S. energy firms, the research reveals that CPU negatively affects CI, even after controlling for firm-specific factors such as size, financial leverage, and profitability. The study also uncovers a complex relationship between CSR and CI under conditions of CPU. While CSR is beneficial for firms' long-term growth and financial health by promoting sustainable practices, it can also intensify the negative impact of CPU on CI for firms with limited financial resources. The findings highlight the critical need to investigate the interplay between CPU, CSR, and CI in the energy sector. This research contributes to energy economics by providing insights into how CPU and CSR shape CI, offering a nuanced perspective on the dual role of CSR in the context of CPU. The results are of academic significance and have practical implications for corporate strategy, policymaking, and investment decisions in an industry central to global climate action and economic progress."

10.1016/j.jafr.2024.100978,"The East of Africa is the least developed region, the most food insecure and the most difficult development challenges in the world. The article review examines seventy-six peer-reviewed articles on climate-linked food insecurity and economic development in the East Africa mostly published 2017-2023. The study evaluates to what extent the literature provides, explain, and illustrate the numerous linkages between climate change, food insecurity and economic development. This study includes two sections; the first section examines the food insecurity, which is a result of violent conflict brought on by the effects of climate change; the second section examines an integrated approach to address conflict related climate change and food insecurity. According to the study, decreased agricultural and economic productivity as a result of climate change is a factor in conflict. Food insecurity and conflict are mutually reinforcing and closely linked. In addition, to lessen the food insecurity, policies must employ conflict related climate change adaptive strategies. The distribution and management of land, water, and other natural resources need to be improved in order to resolve conflicts caused by climate change. For East Africa to develop a successful strategy for addressing conflict-related climate change, participation in the development of resource-sharing agreements and land-use planning needs to be strengthened. Local natural resource management and identification of possible conflict hotspots using early warning, risk assessments, and scenario analysis were suggested as ways to lessen the effects of conflict due to climate change. The key policy implication is that the best strategies to promote long-term food security are to establish the rule of law, set high standards for regulation, protect property rights, establishing national frameworks for resolving climate-related conflicts, and settle conflicts."

How to correctly reflect greenhouse gas emission trend is not only an environmental problem, but also concerns human society's sustainable development. Energy consumption is the primary source of greenhouse gas emission. It is necessary to accurately forecasting energy consumption greenhouse gas emission future trend. COVID-19 epidemic has brought respite from global climate change problem by reducing energy consumption through home office, work stoppage, and global travel ban. However, in the post -epidemic period, energy consumption greenhouse gas emission intensity trend has become the center research field. This study takes global energy consumption carbon emission problem as the main research line and focuses on forecasting global energy consumption carbon dioxide emission trend in major regions based on COVID-19 epidemic shock background. The study considering epidemic shock volatility characteristic. Firstly, fractional order grey mode (FGM(1,1))is used as the baseline model to balance time series data weight. Secondly, Median absolute deviation data preprocessing is introduced to reduce data fluctuation. Finally, a novel delaying pulse shock function optimized background grey forecasting model is also proposed to reflect epidemic shock -response characteristic. The proposed model is compared with existing models. It is found that data preprocessing and novel proposed model not only improves historical data's fitting quality by reflecting COVID-19 epidemic's shock characteristic, but also showed excellent forecasting performance for future trend. The novel grey model largely solves existing model underfitting/overfitting problem. In the end, based on forecasted results, we summarize research conclusion and implication."

The main findings are as follows: First, CCPU has a negative impact on GTFP; Second, the negative impact of CCPU on GTFP varies in different cities according to the population size, location, and environmental regulation level; Third, our empirical results are stable under the robustness tests; Fourth, the further analysis of this paper indicate that the negative impact of CCPU on GTFP mainly comes from the period after 2016. In addition, the negative impact of CCPU is mainly through the channel of the Technical Efficiency.

10.1038/nature04188,"The World Health Organisation estimates that the warming and precipitation trends due to anthropogenic climate change of the past 30 years already claim over 150,000 lives annually. Many prevalent human diseases are linked to climate fluctuations, from cardiovascular mortality and respiratory illnesses due to heatwaves, to altered transmission of infectious diseases and malnutrition from crop failures. Uncertainty remains in attributing the expansion or resurgence of diseases to climate change, owing to lack of long-term, high-quality data sets as well as the large influence of socio-economic factors and changes in immunity and drug resistance. Here we review the growing evidence that climate-health relationships pose increasing health risks under future projections of climate change and that the warming trend over recent decades has already contributed to increased morbidity and mortality in many regions of the world. Potentially vulnerable regions include the temperate latitudes, which are projected to warm disproportionately, the regions around the Pacific and Indian oceans that are currently subjected to large rainfall variability due to the El Nino/Southern Oscillation sub-Saharan Africa and sprawling cities where the urban heat island effect could intensify extreme climatic events."
10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.02.021,"It is commonly accepted that women can be more vulnerable than men to the adverse environmental effects of climate change. This paper evaluates whether the unequal distribution of costs women bear as a result of climate change are reflected across broader macro-social institutions to the detriment of gender equality and women's rights. It argues that gender disparities in climate change vulnerability not only reflect preexisting gender inequalities, they also reinforce them. Inequalities in the ownership and control of household assets and rising familial burdens due to male out-migration, declining food and water access, and increased disaster exposure can undermine women's ability to achieve economic independence, enhance human capital, and maintain health and wellbeing. Consequences for gender equality include reductions in intra-household bargaining power, as women become less capable of generating independent revenue. Outside the home, norms of gender discrimination and gender imbalances in socio-economic status should increase as women are less able to participate in formal labor markets, join civil society organizations, or collectively mobilize for political change. The outcome of these processes can reduce a society's level of gender equality by increasing constraints on the advancement of laws and norms that promote co-equal status. I empirically test this relationship across a sample of developing states between 1981 and 2010. The findings suggest that climate shocks and climatic disasters exert a broadly negative impact on gender equality, as deviations from long-term mean temperatures and increasing incidence of climatological and hydro-meteorological disasters are associated with declines in women's economic and social rights. These effects appear to be most salient in states that are relatively less-democratic, with greater dependence on agriculture, and lower levels of economic development. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

10.1016/j.ijdrr.2021.102351,"Flooding places continuous stress on small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) particularly in developing and transition economies that depend on their firms' performance, but may have not fully developed flood protection infrastructure. Yet, detailed knowledge about whether and how firms take adaptation action against flood hazards, including potential adaptation barriers, is surprisingly thin. We respond to this gap by offering an empirical analysis of small- and medium-sized manufacturing firms in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), one of the front lines of future environmental risk. Drawing on qualitative interviews, our study has two main aims: first, to understand if adaptive action occurs more intensively among firms that previously faced high direct impacts, and second, to shed light on other internal firm characteristics as well as external conditions that determine firm decisions to undertake flood adaptation measures. We find that the majority of firms cope reactively to prevent severe flooding effects. Interestingly, experience with past events, including those of high impact, do not directly lead to long-term strategic adaptation. A lack of business capabilities and financial capacity, combined with insufficient support systems, largely hamper proactive adaptation. This leads to increased risks and selfreinforcing effects, which quickly endanger the future business viability of firms. Future research on adaptation to climate change should seek to improve understanding of adaptive capacities among SMEs, which are quite different from those of large international corporations."

In particular, we primarily discuss empirical papers published in peer-reviewed economics journals focusing on how climate affects energy expenditures and consumption. Climate will affect energy consumption by changing how consumers respond to short run weather shocks (the intensive margin) as well as how people will adapt in the long run (the extensive margin). Along the intensive margin, further research that uses household and firm-level panel data of energy consumption may help identify how energy consumers around the world respond to weather shocks. Research on technology adoption, e.g. air conditioners, will further our understanding of the extensive margin adjustments and their costs. We also note that most of the literature focuses on the residential sector. Similar studies are urgently needed for the industrial and commercial sectors. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

10.1016/j.jfs.2021.100872,"A successful low-carbon transition requires the introduction of policies aimed at aligning investments to the climate and sustainability targets. In this regard, a global Carbon Tax (CT) and a revision of the microprudential banking framework via a Green Supporting Factor (GSF) have been advocated but two main knowledge gaps remain. First, the understanding of the conditions under which the CT or the GSF could contribute to the scaling-up of new green investments or, in contrast, could introduce new sources of risk for macroeconomic and financial stability, is poor. Second, we don't know how banks' climatesentiments, i.e. their anticipation of climate policies' impact in lending conditions, could affect the outcomes of the policies and of the low-carbon transition. To fill these knowledge gaps we develop a Stock-Flow Consistent model of a high income country that embeds an adaptive forecasting function of banks' climate sentiments. Then, we assess the impact of the CT and GSF on the greening of the economy and on the banking sector analyzing the risk transmission channels from the credit market to the economy via loans contracts, and the reinforcing feedbacks that could give rise to cascading effects. Our results suggest that the GSF contributes to scale up green investments only in the short-run but it also introduces potential trade-offs on bank's financial stability. To foster the low-carbon transition while preventing unintended effects on Non-Performing Loans and households' budget, the introduction of the CT should be complemented with redistribution welfare policies. Finally, if banks revise their credit supply conditions based on the firms' carbon profile ahead of climate policy introduction, they can contribute to align investments to the low-carbon transition and improve financial stability of the banking sector.

10.1007/s11027-019-09874-5,"Complex urban ecosystems are relatively fragile in the context of climate change. Given this fragility and the large numbers of urban inhabitants, it is important for researchers and government regulators to assess the adaptation capacity of urban areas with respect to climate change. Currently, there are few studies that have evaluated such adaptation capacity across different regions and periods. In this study, a framework and method are established to assess the adaptation capacity of Chinese cities and urban agglomerations (UAs) with respect to climate change by integrating an SPRR (Source, Pathway, Receptor, Response) model with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment framework. We develop an indicator system for exposure, sensitivity, and resilience and use the set pair analysis (SPA) method to evaluate the adaptation capacity of 12 typical UAs in China. Results show that (1) adaptation capacity levels show wide variation across China, with the majority of cities and UAs having either high or low levels of capacity and a minority having a moderate level of capacity; (2) inland UAs have low adaptation capacity because of low resilience and sensitivity, whereas eastern coastal UAs have high adaptation capacity, for their high resilience and sensitivity; and (3) higher climate change exposures are distributed predominantly in central China. A pronounced economic disparity exists between western inland regions and eastern regions, with the latter having higher levels of economic development and superior infrastructure. The regional economic inequalities and spatial variation in climate variability observed in China are also characteristics shared by many other countries and regions, suggesting that our results may be generalised to other countries and regions. We propose that underdeveloped regions should seek to improve infrastructure and funding directed towards improving adaptation capacity, whereas developed regions should improve their ability to monitor climate change and its impacts."

In the absence of effective adaptation strategies, households that experience difficulties farming due to environmental stress might leave their land. With implications for demography ? through migration ? and political instability ? when affected populations express grievances ? changing landownership patterns could make existing development challenges on the continent even more difficult. We test our hypothesis that drier than average growing seasons will reduce landownership rates using Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). Our DHS dataset includes interviews with 850,961 households in 35 African countries between 2005 and 2017. Compared to regions experiencing weather near the historical average, those with five consecutive dry growing seasons before the DHS experienced a 6.93% decline in the landownership rate. For every additional dry growing season during the five years before each survey, the landownership rate fell by 1.38%. A host of robustness checks support our general conclusion that drying conditions are associated with lower landownership rates."
10.1080/00220388.2021.1898592,"This paper investigates the potential links between climate change, human capital formation, and internal migration in Africa. In order to do so, a two-sector, world economy model that endogenises education and mobility decisions is developed. This stylised model predicts that negative climatic conditions increase the proportion of people moving internally from rural to urban areas. This in turn leads to a larger share of individuals investing in tertiary education, because the access and returns to education are higher in urban areas. These theoretical predictions are empirically validated by a panel data analysis at the country level and a cross-sectional data analysis at the province level. The empirical validation reveals indirect causality between climate change and education via the moderating variable of internal migration. The research leads to the conclusion that adverse weather changes may have the unexpected effect of increasing educational attainment in African economies. The findings suggest that greater internal mobility can explain this effect."
10.3389/fenrg.2024.1374065,"Faced with the impact of climate risks, what responses do local governments make, particularly in the domain of social public policy? This study uses provincial panel data from China from 2009 to 2020 to investigate how climate risks affect local government education expenditure and its mechanisms. Analysis using spatial econometric models reveals the following. First, local climate risks significantly increase government education expenditure. This conclusion remains consistent across different proxy variables, model specifications, and estimation methods. Additionally, there is a spatial dependency on local government education expenditure, meaning that educational spending in neighboring areas positively influences the education expenditure of a specific location. Second, further mechanism analysis shows that climate risks lead to credit easing and drive the digital economic transformation of a location, thereby increasing its education expenditure. Third, considering the heterogeneity in the spatial dimension, it is found that this positive impetus exists only in the economically more developed eastern region. This study provides insights into understanding how the Chinese government responds to the impact of climate risks and its fiscal policy choices."
10.1016/j.jeem.2019.05.004,"This paper examines the effects of extreme temperatures on mortality rates, using random year-to-year variation in temperature based on county-level panel data from China. The analysis finds a robust, U-shaped relationship between temperature and mortality rates, indicating that extremely cold or hot temperatures lead to excess deaths. The heat-related (cold-related) effect is 3.5 times (3.2 times) as large as previous findings that used U.S. data, and it is especially large for the elderly population, mainly due to excess deaths caused by cardiovascular diseases. Applying these results to climate change predictions from Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model shows that by 2061-2080 the annual mortality rate is likely to increase by 142% if global greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise throughout the 21st century, the estimated health cost of which is around 0.98 trillion Chinese Yuan per year. The paper also explores households' adaptation behaviors to extreme temperatures. It finds that although urban households adaptively increase energy consumption when they are exposed to cold temperatures and purchase more air conditioners on hot and cold days, rural households are unresponsive to temperature fluctuations. This finding implies that rural people may be more resource constrained and suffer more when extreme temperatures occur. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
10.1111/obes.12536,"Standard panel models usually assume that data are available at the same frequency. Occasionally, researchers might work with variables sampled at different frequencies. A common practice is to aggregate all variables to the same frequency by an equal weighting scheme. We show that such a simple aggregation scheme results in biases for common estimators. We propose a data-driven method to determine weights for aggregation. We further demonstrate that, in contrast with single-frequency panel models, the Mundlak device and the Chamberlain's approach lead to different estimators for panels with mixed sampling frequencies. The proposed estimators have satisfying finite sample performances in various simulation designs. As an empirical illustration, we apply the new method to the estimation of the effects of temperature fluctuations on economic growth. The empirical evidence shows that the temperature shocks mainly work through the level effect instead of the growth effect for poor countries."

The climate change research community is developing new scenarios integrating future changes in climate and society to investigate climate impacts as well as options for mitigation and adaptation. One component of these new scenarios is a set of alternative futures of societal development known as the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). The conceptual framework for the design and use of the SSPs calls for the development of global pathways describing the future evolution of key aspects of society that would together imply a range of challenges for mitigating and adapting to climate change. Here we present one component of these pathways: the SSP narratives, a set of five qualitative descriptions of future changes in demographics, human development, economy and lifestyle, policies and institutions, technology, and environment and natural resources. We describe the methods used to develop the narratives as well as how these pathways are hypothesized to produce particular combinations of challenges to mitigation and adaptation. Development of the narratives drew on expert opinion to (1) identify key determinants of these challenges that were essential to incorporate in the narratives and (2) combine these elements in the narratives in a manner consistent with scholarship on their inter-relationships. The narratives are intended as a description of plausible future conditions at the level of large world regions that can serve as a basis for integrated scenarios of emissions and land use, as well as climate impact, adaptation and vulnerability analyses.

Understanding farmers' adaptive responses to cope with these challenges is pivotal for informing and implementing effective climate resilience policies. This study utilizes the Spatial Precipitation Index (SPI) to assess rainfall patterns and applies fixed effects methods to analyze extreme rainfall shocks' impact on rural households, using panel data from China's 2006-2015 National Rural Fixed Point Survey. Below are the results. Firstly, both drought and rainstorm shocks negatively affect agricultural yield and income, highlighting farmers' vulnerability to extreme rainfall events. Secondly, farmers respond to these shocks by reallocating labor from agriculture to non-agricultural sectors or migrating to urban areas, with these labor mobility patterns typically being temporary. Thirdly, there's notable heterogeneity linked to household affluence. Less affluent rural households experienced more pronounced declines in yield and income, compelling higher migration rates. Collectively, our findings shed light on how Chinese rural households strategically adjust their labor decisions to respond to extreme rainfall shocks through inter-sectoral and inter -regional labor mobility."

Based on panel data of 60 countries for the period 2000-2019, we show that CR is not conducive to RETI, and that its negative marginal impact shows an inverted U-shaped trend with the improvement of RETI. Heterogeneity analysis shows that floods and storms have the greatest negative impacts on RETI, and that innovations in solar and wind energy technologies are more vulnerable to the adverse shocks of CR. Furthermore, CR has a greater adverse effect on RETI in developing countries than in developed countries. However, the institutional environment, especially the economic institutional environment, can work to mitigate the negative effect of CR on RETI. Our findings not only enrich the research on the economic consequences of CR but also provide effective ways to mitigate the adverse impact of CR on RETI from the perspective of institutional environment."
10.1038/s41586-021-04283-8,"Macro-economic assessments of climate impacts lack an analysis of the distribution of daily rainfall, which can resolve both complex societal impact channels and anthropogenically forced changes(1-6). Here, using a global panel of subnational economic output for 1,554 regions worldwide over the past 40 years, we show that economic growth rates are reduced by increases in the number of wet days and in extreme daily rainfall, in addition to responding nonlinearly to the total annual and to the standardized monthly deviations of rainfall. Furthermore, high-income nations and the services and manufacturing sectors are most strongly hindered by both measures of daily rainfall, complementing previous work that emphasized the beneficial effects of additional total annual rainfall in low-income, agriculturally dependent economies(4,7). By assessing the distribution of rainfall at multiple timescales and the effects on different sectors, we uncover channels through which climatic conditions can affect the economy. These results suggest that anthropogenic intensification of daily rainfall extremes(8-10) will have negative global economic consequences that require further assessment by those who wish to evaluate the costs of anthropogenic climate change."
10.1111/joes.12651,"Climate change-driven extreme heat events pose a major threat to urban expansion globally. This study evaluates the relationship between extreme heat and housing prices utilizing panel data from Chinese cities between 2009 and 2019. Our findings indicate a significant negative correlation between housing prices and extreme temperatures. Specifically, we observe a 0.1% reduction in housing prices for each additional day per year with temperatures surpassing 35 degrees C. This research evaluates two primary mechanisms underpinning this finding. Firstly, our analysis demonstrates a decline in labor inflows to cities experiencing extreme heat, with a particularly significant effect on the influx of high-skilled workers. In addition, existing residents in these hotter urban environments exhibit reduced home-buying intentions and reduced proclivity for long-term residency, coupled with higher living costs. Secondly, our findings indicate that extreme heat acts as a deterrent to firm entry, thereby further suppressing housing demand. This study contributes valuable empirical insights into the capitalization of climate risk in housing markets, with a specific emphasis on the effect of extreme heat. Moreover, it highlights the urgent necessity for the development and implementation of sustainable adaptation strategies to reduce the negative effects of evolving climatic conditions."
10.3390/ijerph19052523,"Background: The long-term effect of abnormal climate on cognitive function and socioeconomic status remains elusive. We explored the association between prenatal exposure to climate anomaly and adulthood cognitive function and job reputation. Methods: We obtained repeated cognitive and job reputation measurements from 17,105 subjects for the years 2010, 2014, and 2018, and ascertained their birth date and other covariates. We used sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the Southern Pacific Ocean as the indicator for global climate anomaly in the main analyses. We calculated its averaged values for different gestational periods and analyzed its possible nonlinear associations with adulthood cognitive function and job reputation. We also calculated associated economic loss due to prenatal exposure to abnormal climate. Results: We found an inverted U-shaped curve between climate anomaly and adulthood cognition. During the entire pregnancy, for SST anomalies increasing/decreasing 1 degrees C from 0 degrees C, newborn individuals will have adulthood cognition (measured by math test) changed by -2.09% (95% confidence interval (CI): -2.31%, -1.88%) and -3.98% (95% CI: -4.32%, -3.65%), respectively. We observed a similar inverted U-shaped pattern for cognitive function measured by word test and job reputation. Such an association is likely to be mediated by regional meteorological conditions, not local ones. Subgroup analyses identified females and people from less-developed regions as even more vulnerable to prenatal abnormal climate, finding an interactive effect with other social factors. The economic loss was assessed as the salary reduction due to declined cognition among all newborn individuals in China. For SST anomalies increasing/decreasing by 1 degrees C from 0 degrees C, individuals born each year in China would earn 0.33 (95% CI: 0.40, 0.25) and 1.09 (95% CI: 1.23, 0.94) billion U.S. dollars equivalent less in their annual salary at adulthood because of lowered cognitive function, respectively. Conclusion: Prenatal exposure to abnormal global climate patterns can result in declined adulthood cognitive function, lowered job reputation, and subsequent economic loss."
10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2020.101743,"Motivated by the prevalence of corporate sustainability and the rise of uncertainty at the national level, we investigate the impact of three sources of uncertainty; namely, economic policy, climate change, and political instability, on firms' sustainability performance. Using a sample of 6804 firms from 72 countries spanning 15 years, our study revealed that uncertainty due to climate change, economic policy, and political instability negatively affects firms' sustainability performance. This finding is in line with the real options theory that uncertainty in an external environment discourages firms' long-term investment (e.g. investment in corporate sustainability). In addition, the results show that the option for delay in sustainability investment moderated the relation between uncertainty at the national level and firms' sustainability performance. Firms with better sustainability performance had higher firm value when facing uncertainty. Interestingly, firms with higher profitability performed better in sustainability when facing uncertainty at the national level."
10.1073/pnas.1813951115,"Different regions of the world have had different historical patterns of emissions of carbon dioxide, other greenhouse gases, and aerosols as well as different land-use changes. One can estimate the net cumulative contribution by each region to the global mean radiative forcing due to past greenhouse gas emissions, aerosol precursors, and carbon dioxide from land-use changes. Several patterns stand out from such calculations. Some regions have had a common historical pattern in which the short-term offsets between the radiative forcings from carbon dioxide and sulfate aerosols temporarily led to near-zero radiative forcing during periods of exponential emissions growth with few emission controls. This happened for North America and Europe in the mid-20th century and China in the 1990s and 2000s. However, these same periods lead to a commitment to future radiative forcing from the carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that stay in the atmosphere long after the aerosols. For every region, this commitment to future radiative forcing (2018-2100) from emissions already in the atmosphere is larger than the cumulative radiative forcing to date (1900-2017). This comparison again highlights how the full radiative forcing from greenhouse gases is unmasked once the aerosol emissions are reduced to improve air quality. The relative contributions from various regions to global climate forcing depends more on the time the contributions are compared (e.g., now or 2100) and future development scenarios than on whether cumulative radiative forcing, ocean heat content, or temperature is used to compare regional contributions."
10.1093/ajae/aaw042,"Large rural-urban wage gaps observed in many developing countries are suggestive of barriers to migration that keep potential migrants in rural areas. Using long panel data spanning nearly two decades, I study the extent to which migration rates are constrained by liquidity constraints in rural Tanzania. The analysis begins by quantifying the impact of weather variation on household welfare. The results show how household consumption co-moves with temperature, rendering households vulnerable to local weather events. These temperature-induced income shocks are then found to inhibit long-term migration among men, thus preventing them from tapping into the opportunities brought about by geographical mobility."
10.1016/j.ecolecon.2022.107627,"More frequent and punctuated severe events such as dry spells are among the more salient manifestations of climate change. Because dry spells often co-occur both with heat waves and with longer-term agricultural drought and their effects may interact, understanding the effects of dry spells and heat waves requires a multi-timescale and multi-stressor perspective. Using a global panel of daily precipitation and temperature from 1979 to 2016, we provide evidence that 4-5 week dry spells that occur during the hottest part of the year depress growth in aggregate crop production. The effects of these extreme events are modified by existing drought, aridity, and by heat waves. Our findings, focused on punctuated events, multiple stressors, and aggregate crop production across the globe, complement prior investigations focused solely on longer-term phenomena, those that study extreme heat or precipitation in isolation, and studies that restrict attention to a small number of crops or locations."
10.3390/geosciences9100411,"In the next decades, climate change will put forests in the Hungarian Great Plain in the Carpathian Basin to the test, e.g., changing seasonal patterns, more intense storms, longer dry periods, and pests are expected to occur. To aid in the decision-making process for the conservation of ecosystems depending on forestry, how woods could adapt to changing meso- and microclimatic conditions in the near future needs to be defined. In addition to trendlike warming processes, calculations show an increase in climate extremes, which need to be monitored in accordance with spatial planning, at least for medium-scale mappings. We can use the MODIS sensor dataset if up-to-date terrestrial conditions and multi-decadal geographical processes are of interest. For geographic evaluations of changes, we used vegetation spectral indices; Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), based on the summer half year, 16-day MODIS data composites between 2000 and 2017 in an intensively forested study area in the Hungarian Great Plain. We delineated forest areas on the Danube-Tisza Interfluve using Corine Land Cover maps (2000, 2006, and 2012). Mid-year changes over the nearly two-decade-long period are currently in balance; however, based on their reactions, forests are highly sensitive to abrupt changes caused by extreme climatic events. The higher occurrence of years or periods with extreme water shortages marks an observable decrease in biomass production, even in shorter index time series, such as that between 2004 and 2012. In the drought-stricken July-August periods, the effect of a dry year, subsequent to years with more precipitation, immediately pushes back the green mass and the reduction in the biomass production could become persistent, according to climatology predictions. The changes of specific sub-periods in the vegetation period can be evaluated even in a relatively short, 18-year data series, including the change in the growing values of the vegetative growth in spring or the increase in the summertime biomass production. Standardized differences highlight spatial differences in the biomass production; in response to years with the highest (negative) biomass difference; typically, the northern and southwestern parts of the Danube-Tisza Interfluve in the study area have longer lasting losses in biomass production. A comparison of NDVI and EVI values with the PaDI drought index and the vegetation indices of LANDSAT Operational Land Imager sensor respectively confirms our results."
10.1016/j.eneco.2024.107813,"Despite concerted global efforts to curb environmental degradation (proxied by greenhouse gas emissions), climate change mitigation policies appear to be failing in reducing carbon emissions, with considerable differences in the levels and rates of emissions across countries. To bridge the gap between the observed national commitments to climate targets and the reality of rising greenhouse gas emissions, this paper examines how the incentives generated by resource endowments and commodity windfalls (proxied by international commodity price booms or fluctuations) are critical for our understanding. Using a significantly larger and more representative international sample than extant research, we document, applying both static and dynamic econometric techniques to a panel of 179 countries during the period 1970-2018, that a rise in commodity windfalls has a positive and significant effect on carbon emissions. We then explore classification of countries into democracies and autocracies as potential channels for the heterogeneous effects of commodity windfalls on environmental quality, finding that a rise in international prices of exported commodities significantly leads to an increase in carbon emissions in democratic countries, with no significant effect on carbon emissions in autocratic countries. These results are robust to various sensitivity checks."
10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2016.05.009,"This paper presents the overview of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and their energy, land use, and emissions implications. The SSPs are part of a new scenario framework, established by the climate change research community in order to facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation. The pathways were developed over the last years as a joint community effort and describe plausible major global developments that together would lead in the future to different challenges for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. The SSPs are based on five narratives describing alternative socio-economic developments, including sustainable development, regional rivalry, inequality, fossil-fueled development, and middle-of-the-road development. The long-term demographic and economic projections of the SSPs depict a wide uncertainty range consistent with the scenario literature. A multi-model approach was used for the elaboration of the energy, land-use and the emissions trajectories of SSP-based scenarios. The baseline scenarios lead to global energy consumption of 400-1200 EJ in 2100, and feature vastly different land-use dynamics, ranging from a possible reduction in cropland area up to a massive expansion by more than 700 million hectares by 2100. The associated annual CO2 emissions of the baseline scenarios range from about 25 GtCO(2) to more than 120 GtCO(2) per year by 2100. With respect to mitigation, we find that associated costs strongly depend on three factors: (1) the policy assumptions, (2) the socio-economic narrative, and (3) the stringency of the target. The carbon price for reaching the target of 2.6 W/m(2) that is consistent with a temperature change limit of 2 degrees C, differs in our analysis thus by about a factor of three across the SSP marker scenarios. Moreover, many models could not reach this target from the SSPs with high mitigation challenges. While the SSPs were designed to represent different mitigation and adaptation challenges, the resulting narratives and quantifications span a wide range of different futures broadly representative of the current literature. This allows their subsequent use and development in new assessments and research projects. Critical next steps for the community scenario process will, among others, involve regional and sectoral extensions, further elaboration of the adaptation and impacts dimension, as well as employing the SSP scenarios with the new generation of earth system models as part of the 6th climate model intercomparison project (CMIP6).

10.1016/j.ecolecon.2024.108342,"We employ detailed monthly temperature data and a nationally representative survey of Chinese older adults to examine the effects of exposure to high temperature on older adults' life satisfaction. A large literature evaluates the objective damage of climate change, but less attention has been paid to subjective well-being of the older population. Given the widely documented distinction of experienced and decision utilities and the trend of global aging, we offer another angle for evaluating the damage of climate change. Our results consistently show that exposure to (extreme) high temperatures significantly lower the older adults' life satisfaction. We link the adaptability of older adults to their life-course experiences and find that early-life resources can be as important as adult-life resources for older adults to adapt to late-life high temperatures. We document both efficiency and equality implications of climate change on the older population."
10.3390/en14248339,"The world has experienced increased impacts of anthropogenic global warming due to increased emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), which include carbon dioxide (CO2). Anthropogenic activities that contribute to CO2 emissions include deforestation, usage of fertilizers, and activities related to mining and energy production. The main objective of this paper was to assess the impacts of agriculture and energy production on CO2 emissions in Zambia. This research used econometric analysis, specifically the Autoregressive-Distributed Lag (ARDL) Bounds Test, to analyze the relationship between CO2 emissions and GDP, electricity consumption, agricultural production, and industry value added. The results showed the presence of cointegration, where the variables of CO2 emissions, GDP, electricity, and agriculture converge to a long-run equilibrium at the rate of 74%. Further, there was a short-run causality towards CO2 emissions running from agriculture and the consumption of energy as indicated by the Wald test. This is the first study of its kind that empirically shows the impact of agricultural activities and energy consumption on the Zambian environment through their contribution to CO2 emissions at a macro (country) level. This paper also presents recommendations that are pertinent to mitigate these effects. To deescalate environmental degradation, we propose increasing the number of access points for multiple renewable energy sources across the country; discouraging deforestation, the usage of conventional fertilizers, and the burning of vegetation for fertilizers; encouraging afforestation and reforestation, in addition to providing subsidies, training, and financial support to farmers and entrepreneurs who decide to use environmentally friendly agricultural methods and renewable energy. This research highlights the serious impacts of anthropogenic activities on CO2 emissions. The study was intended to assist Zambian policymakers in formulating and implementing environmentally friendly policy measures or systems that will contribute towards environmental protection commitments and sustainable economic development."
10.1073/pnas.0609584104,"Previous studies have found that atmospheric brown clouds partially offset the warming effects of greenhouse gases. This finding suggests a tradeoff between the impacts of reducing emissions of aerosols and greenhouse gases. Results from a statistical model of historical rice harvests in India, coupled with regional climate scenarios from a parallel climate model, indicate that joint reductions in brown clouds and greenhouse gases would in fact have complementary, positive impacts on harvests. The results also imply that adverse climate changes due to brown clouds and greenhouse gases contributed to the slowdown in harvest growth that occurred during the past two decades."
10.3390/rs15040970,"The rapid loss of Arctic Sea ice cover and thickness diminishes the surface albedo, which increases the ocean's absorption of solar heat and exacerbates the Arctic amplification effect. According to the most recent research from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the Sixth Assessment Report (IPCC, AR6), the extent of summer sea ice is anticipated to decrease below 1 million km(2) by the 2050s as a result of the extreme climate. Nevertheless, past and future changes in sea ice albedo radiative forcing and the resulting economic cost remain to be explored in systematic and multi-disciplinary manners. In this study, we first analyze the evolution of Arctic sea ice radiative forcing (SIRF) from 1982 to 2100 using a radiative kernel method based on albedo data from the Polar Pathfinder-Extent (APP-x) and Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5). Then, the SIRF is converted to CO2 equivalent emissions via the Dynamic Integrated Model of Climate and Economy (DICE) model. Finally, the associated costs are calculated using the substitute cost method, based on the social cost of carbon to achieve the Paris Agreement targets. The results show that the average Arctic SIRF was -0.75 +/- 0.1 Wmiddotm(-2) between 1982 and 2020, and increased by 0.12 Wmiddotm(-2) during this period. The SIRF in April-June accounts for nearly 77% of the average annual value, with a maximum absolute value of -3.2 Wmiddotm(-2) in May. Through model transformation, it is shown that the Arctic SIRF rising leads to global warming comparable to the effect of an increase of 34.5 Gt of CO2 in the atmosphere relative to pre-industrialization, and results in a loss of 24.4-48.8 trillion USD for climate regulation service (CRS). From 2020 to 2100, in the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5, the Arctic SIRF is projected to increase by 0.31 Wmiddotm(-2). Combined with the discount rate, the estimated average annual cost over the period ranges from 6.7-13.3 trillion USD. These findings provide a systematic understanding of the radiative effect of Arctic sea ice change on the global climate and the corresponding economic cost."
10.1073/pnas.1702436114,"We study how exposure to extreme temperatures in early periods of child development is related to adult economic outcomes measured 30 y later. Our analysis uses administrative earnings records for over 12 million individuals born in the United States between 1969 and 1977, linked to fine-scale, daily weather data and location and date of birth. We calculate the length of time each individual is exposed to different temperatures in utero and in early childhood, and we estimate flexible regression models that allow for nonlinearities in the relationship between temperature and long-run outcomes. We find that an extra day with mean temperatures above 32 degrees C in utero and in the first year after birth is associated with a 0.1% reduction in adult annual earnings at age 30. Temperature sensitivity is evident in multiple periods of early development, ranging from the first trimester of gestation to age 6-12 mo. We observe that household air-conditioning adoption, which increased dramatically over the time period studied, mitigates nearly all of the estimated temperature sensitivity."
10.1016/j.jafr.2024.101373,"The US corn area footprint has changed significantly since the 20th century, declining in the southeastern states while exhibiting an increase or stable variations in the Midwest. As harvested acreage directly impacts the total corn production, understanding the influencing factors is crucial. This study assesses the role of potential drivers on the contrasting trajectories of harvested corn acreage between midwestern and southeastern US. Profit- acreage analysis reveals that antecedent profits/losses have a statistically significant influence on corn acreage changes, with southeastern US, which experienced more loss-making years, also experiencing more frequent reductions in corn acreage. The high number of loss-making years in the Southeast is primarily attributed to the region's low corn yield, influenced by climate and other agro-environmental factors. Using a panel regression model, we find that the loss-making years in the Southeast could have reduced to fewer than 26 out of the considered 45 years, or almost similar to the average in the Midwest, by just increasing the irrigated corn area to 50 %, a realistic irrigated corn area fraction already achieved in several Georgia counties. This underscores the potential for early policy interventions like irrigation facilitation to sustain and expand cropped acreage. However, we also find that this would only be economically feasible with incentives for both the installation and sustained operation of irrigation infrastructure."
10.1080/14693062.2022.2086843,"Labour markets of oil-exporting regions will be impacted by a global transition to low-carbon energy as oil demand reduces to meet the aims of the Paris Agreement. Together with direct job losses in the oil and gas industry, indirect employment effects on other sectors should also be considered to ensure a just transition. We explore these direct and indirect employment impacts that could result from the low-carbon transition by analysing the effect of oil price fluctuations on the labour market of Alberta, a Canadian province economically reliant on oil sands extraction. We employ a mixed methods approach, contextualizing our quantitative analysis with first-hand experiences of career transitions using interviews with oil sands workers. We estimate a vector autoregression for province-wide insights and explore sector-specific dynamics using time series regressions. We find that the price discount on Canadian oil sands, which is determined by local factors like crude oil quality and pipeline capacity, does not significantly affect employment, while the global oil price does. This finding puts in doubt claims of long-term employment benefits from new pipelines. We find that at a provincial scale, oil price fluctuations lead to employment levels also fluctuating. Our analysis at the sectoral level shows that these job fluctuations extend beyond oil and gas to other sectors, such as construction and some service sectors. These findings suggest that the province's current economic dependence on oil creates job precarity because employment in various sectors is sensitive to a volatile oil market. Furthermore, due to this sectoral sensitivity to oil price changes, workers in these sectors may be especially at risk in a low-carbon transition and warrant special attention in the development of provincial and national just transition policies. Transitional assistance can support workers directly, while economic diversification in Alberta can reduce reliance on international oil markets and thereby ensure stable opportunities in existing and new sectors. Key policy insights Decreased global oil demand is likely to create employment risks for workers in Alberta and other fossil fuel producing regions of the world. Current economic dependence on oil sands extraction in Alberta leads to job precarity across sectors, including in those seemingly unrelated to extraction. Proactive economic diversification in anticipation of the low-carbon transition could reduce precarity by mitigating the effects of oil price fluctuations on employment levels in the long term. Workers in sectors with higher oil price sensitivity (i.e. oil and gas, construction, professional services, manufacturing, accommodations, and food services sectors) could be prioritized in coordinated just transition policies at the local, provincial, and national scales. The details of career transitions gleaned from our interviews suggest that tripartite social dialogue would contribute meaningfully to just transition policy development."
10.1016/j.enpol.2023.113628,"The demand for renewable energy is growing worldwide due to environmental degradation. However, in poor countries, the use of renewable energy may be impeded by the level of poverty and income inequality. Therefore, this paper studies the income inequality impact on renewable energy demand in seven South Asian economies by using the balanced panel data from 1996 to 2018. The study employs generalized methods of moments (GMM) estimation technique followed by other econometric approaches to check the robustness of findings. The renewable energy demand function includes economic growth, carbon emissions, and government effectiveness as control variables. The study has found the adverse effects of income inequality, economic growth, and carbon emissions on renewable energy demand. Government effectiveness also drives renewable energy use. The findings are robust and reliable concerning panel data methods used in the analysis. These findings bear important policies for a sustainable environment in South Asian economies."
10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.171704,"Greenhouse gas emissions are considered the culprit of extreme high temperatures, and low-carbon transformation has become a global consensus. The low-carbon action by enterprises is an inevitable choice if they are to adapt to economic and social needs. Green innovation is an important measure for enterprises to respond to the challenges of low-carbon transformation. This study mainly discusses the causal relationship between extreme high temperatures and green innovation of enterprises. Using China's industrial enterprise database, we construct county-annual panel data from 2000 to 2013. Results show that extreme high temperatures improve the level of green innovation of enterprises. After a series of robustness tests, the results remain. Mechanism analysis shows that extreme high temperatures increase the environmental concerns of the government, the public, and society, thus strengthening government regulation, public participation, and social supervision as well as encouraging enterprises to carry out green innovation. Our heterogeneous analysis shows that in the eastern region with a high level of legal system and economic development, it is easier to promote green innovation for enterprises. In addition, large-scale enterprises are more willing to carry out green innovation after experiencing a heat wave."
10.1038/s41467-021-22211-2,"The large majority of climate change mitigation scenarios that hold warming below 2 degrees C show high deployment of carbon dioxide removal (CDR), resulting in a peak-and-decline behavior in global temperature. This is driven by the assumption of an exponentially increasing carbon price trajectory which is perceived to be economically optimal for meeting a carbon budget. However, this optimality relies on the assumption that a finite carbon budget associated with a temperature target is filled up steadily over time. The availability of net carbon removals invalidates this assumption and therefore a different carbon price trajectory should be chosen. We show how the optimal carbon price path for remaining well below 2 degrees C limits CDR demand and analyze requirements for constructing alternatives, which may be easier to implement in reality. We show that warming can be held at well below 2 degrees C at much lower long-term economic effort and lower CDR deployment and therefore lower risks if carbon prices are high enough in the beginning to ensure target compliance, but increase at a lower rate after carbon neutrality has been reached. Many trajectories for reaching climate change mitigation targets exaggerate the long-term need for CO2 removal (CDR) because they assume an exponentially increasing carbon price. Here the authors analyse alternative carbon price pathways that halt warming while limiting CDR, and may be easier to implement."
10.1007/s11356-019-07092-9,"Forecasting CO2 emissions is the bases of making environmental planning and ecological strategy decisions. This paper constructed a multi-sector intertemporal optimization model to forecast the CO2 emission trends of 14 industrial departments in 31 provinces of China from 2012 to 2050. The results indicate that (1) the energy efficiency level of each province will be improved continuously under the influence of technology progress, and CO2 emissions in most provinces will reach the peak during the forecast period. (2) CO2 emissions of metal-manufacturing industries are the highest in all provinces, and the emissions of transportation service industries, construction industries, and other service industries show a trend of gradual increase from west to east. (3) Under the influence of the capital and technology, CO2 emissions caused by transportation service industries in eastern provinces will reach the peak earlier than those in central and western regions. (4) Combined with the industrial structure and the technical input level, the chemical industries in the western provinces have a great potential for emission reduction. Moreover, construction and transportation industries in the eastern and central provinces have a great potential for emission reduction."
10.1038/s43017-020-0079-1,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused substantial global impact. This Perspective provides insight into the environmental effects of the pandemic, documenting how it offers an opportunity to better understand the Earth System. Restrictions to reduce human interaction have helped to avoid greater suffering and death from the COVID-19 pandemic, but have also created socioeconomic hardship. This disruption is unprecedented in the modern era of global observing networks, pervasive sensing and large-scale tracking of human mobility and behaviour, creating a unique test bed for understanding the Earth System. In this Perspective, we hypothesize the immediate and long-term Earth System responses to COVID-19 along two multidisciplinary cascades: energy, emissions, climate and air quality; and poverty, globalization, food and biodiversity. While short-term impacts are dominated by direct effects arising from reduced human activity, longer-lasting impacts are likely to result from cascading effects of the economic recession on global poverty, green investment and human behaviour. These impacts offer the opportunity for novel insight, particularly with the careful deployment of targeted data collection, coordinated model experiments and solution-oriented randomized controlled trials, during and after the pandemic."

Together with integrated assessment models, these values are ever more useful for environmental management. This article briefly reviews revealed preference methods, which infer values from observed behavior. A new emphasis in this literature has been to exploit the intertemporal properties of panel data to value the environment. These panel methods have great potential, but the literature needs to develop theoretical and empirical best practices. The article also examines the latest empirical results across several environmental issues: climate change, pollution, and conservation. Valuation methods continue to be applied to additional issues and locations. Looking toward the future, technical change and economic growth suggest that additional pollutants and global-scale effects will emerge. Valuation methods need to keep pace with these new developments to be able to address the key environmental management challenges of the future."

Our results show that, in large parts of Europe, future heat exposure will indeed exceed critical levels for physically active humans far more often than in today's climate, and labour productivity might be largely reduced in southern Europe. European industries should adapt to the projected changes to prevent major consequences for the workers' health and to preserve economic productivity."
10.5194/nhess-22-2567-2022,"Sustainable flood risk management (SFRM) has become popular since the 1980s. Many governmental and non-governmental organisations have been keen on implementing the SFRM strategies by integrating social, ecological, and economic themes into their flood risk management (FRM) practices. However, the justifications for SFRM are still somewhat embryonic, and it is not yet clear whether this concept is influencing current policies in different countries. This paper reviews the past and current flood management experiences from flood defence to SFRM in four developed countries to highlight lessons for coastal megacities in development. The paper explores recent strategies such as Making Space for Water, Planning Policy Statement 25 (PPS25), and the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) in the UK and Room for the River in the Netherlands, which were implemented to mitigate flooding, integrate FRM with sustainability concepts, and deliver sound FRM practice for future generations. In this context, the United States has also established a National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), and in a different approach, Japan has developed an advanced flood warning and evacuation contingency system to prepare for climatic extremes. These case studies give good lessons in achieving long-term SFRM to deliver sound flood management practices considering socio-economic and environmental concerns. Most developing coastal megacities especially in Asia are still heavily reliant on a traditional hard-engineering approach, which may not be enough to mitigate substantial risks due to human factors (e.g. large population, rapid socio-economic growth, subsidence from excessive groundwater extraction) and natural factors (e.g. climate change including sea-level rise and land subsidence). It is clear that different countries and cities have their interpretation of SFRM, but this paper explores how policymakers can adopt mixed options to move towards long-term thinking about sustainability with social, economic, and environmental considerations."
10.1073/pnas.1008279108,"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projects that temperatures in the major grain-growing areas of North America will rise by 3-4 degrees C by 2100. Such abrupt changes will create major challenges, significantly altering the area suitable for wheat. The historical record offers insight into the capability of agriculture to adapt to climatic challenges. Using a new county-level dataset on wheat production and climate norms, we show that during the 19th and 20th centuries North American grain farmers pushed wheat production into environments once considered too arid, too variable, and too harsh to cultivate. As summary measures, the median annual precipitation norm of the 2007 distribution of North American wheat production was one-half that of the 1839 distribution, and the median annual temperature norm was 3.7 degrees C lower. This shift, which occurred mostly before 1929, required new biological technologies. The Green Revolution associated with the pioneering work of Norman Borlaug represented an important advance in this longer process of biological innovation. However, well before the Green Revolution, generations of North American farmers overcame significant climatic challenges."
10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.09.026,"While the harmful impact of droughts is well-documented in rural areas, how droughts affect cities' economies remains an open question. Using monthly labour force surveys from 78 cities in Latin America, we demonstrate that large sustained dry events decrease the probability of being employed, hourly wages, hours worked, and labour incomes. Informal workers are impacted the most. We highlight that the impact of droughts is larger than the impact of wet events, like those that cause floods. Health and power outages are two pathways explaining our results. Climate change will increase the occurrence of droughts, making our findings particularly relevant.

10.1007/s00181-023-02454-2,"Climate change imposes an existential threat on the globe and has already had sizeable economic costs to countries. Environmental aid flows aim to alleviate the rising concerns of climate change in the developing world. Even though the existing literature has examined the effectiveness of green aid flows for reducing carbon dioxide emissions in the recipient countries, no existing study has examined the effectiveness of different classifications of green aid. Examining the green aid flows to 97 developing countries between 2002 and 2018, we find that all types of green aid significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions; however, the aid flows targeting the environmental objectives are more effective in reducing carbon dioxide emissions compared to the aid flows that do not target environmental objectives or are not screened. The findings highlight that more aid should be screened and targeted for environmental objectives to increase the effectiveness of green aid flows in developing countries."
10.1016/j.erss.2019.01.017,"The German Energiewende is facing new challenges with increasing shares of fluctuating renewable energies. Slow electricity grid extensions, restrictions in public perception as well as limited transformation progress in other sectors beside electricity cause major drawbacks in greenhouse gas mitigation. Power-to-X (PtX) technologies may be the missing link for a more resilient energy transition and provide both, renewable substitutes for fossil fuels as well as electricity grid balancing services owing to flexible operation and long-term storage abilities. Different PtX concepts proved operability in several worldwide distributed pilot projects. However, little is known yet about potential technical, monetary, societal and resource related scale-up limitations. In this paper, implications of these aspects for a large-scale energy system implementation are shown. From a technical perspective the concept of long-term flexible PtX operation modes is generally feasible and could become key for a more resilient future energy supply. However, economics are still the bottleneck for an extensive diffusion: in two scenarios for 2050 PtX may cause additional national annual energy costs between approx. 10 and 100 billion euros compared to an ongoing fossil fuel supply at current price conditions. Nevertheless, such expenses can be considered as reasonable in contrast to expenses for the compensation of climate change consequences of a future fossil fuel-based energy system."
10.1007/s10640-022-00680-3,"A large fraction of the world's poor rely on rain-fed agriculture, which makes them vulnerable to changes in rainfall patterns. In this paper, we examine whether spatial correlation in rainfall results in these households also being vulnerable to an adverse spatial-spillover effect. In particular, we use household-level panel data from India along with high-resolution meteorological data to show how rural household consumption varies with own-region rainfall as well as rainfall in neighboring areas. We find that while greater own rainfall has a positive effect on rural household consumption, greater rainfall in neighboring regions has an adverse spatial-spillover effect. Our results suggest that when this spillover effect is taken into account, the positive impact of own-region rainfall on household consumption falls by 38 percent."
10.1007/s10584-011-0149-y,"This paper summarizes the main characteristics of the RCP8.5 scenario. The RCP8.5 combines assumptions about high population and relatively slow income growth with modest rates of technological change and energy intensity improvements, leading in the long term to high energy demand and GHG emissions in absence of climate change policies. Compared to the total set of Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), RCP8.5 thus corresponds to the pathway with the highest greenhouse gas emissions. Using the IIASA Integrated Assessment Framework and the MESSAGE model for the development of the RCP8.5, we focus in this paper on two important extensions compared to earlier scenarios: 1) the development of spatially explicit air pollution projections, and 2) enhancements in the land-use and land-cover change projections. In addition, we explore scenario variants that use RCP8.5 as a baseline, and assume different degrees of greenhouse gas mitigation policies to reduce radiative forcing. Based on our modeling framework, we find it technically possible to limit forcing from RCP8.5 to lower levels comparable to the other RCPs (2.6 to 6 W/m(2)). Our scenario analysis further indicates that climate policy-induced changes of global energy supply and demand may lead to significant co-benefits for other policy priorities, such as local air pollution."

10.1016/j.forpol.2019.101999,"Known as the Four Forest Restoration Initiative (4FRI), the US Forest Service is planning a large-scale restoration of ponderosa pine forests in the Verde River watershed in central Arizona, USA. This paper uses a reduced-form econometric regression model with 1969-2010 time-series data to estimate the economic benefits of the increased water yield due to planned forest restoration of the first phase of 4FRI. We split the data sample into 1969-1989 and 1990-2010 time periods, and conclude during the second time period, water use is statistically and economically significant. This is consistent with the reality that the Verde River watershed has been in drought since the early 1990s. Our central finding is, if water use increases by 1%, the farm income will increase by 1.33%. If a 5-10% increase in water yield caused by the first phase of the 4FRI is all used by agriculture, agricultural income will increase by 6.65-13.3% annually."
10.1007/s11027-023-10103-3,"Does climate change influence if societies will be better or worse equipped to reduce climatic risks in the future? A society's adaptive capacity determines whether the potential of adaptation to reduce risks will be realized. Assumptions about the level of adaptive capacity are inherently made when the potential for adaptation to reduce risks in the future and resultant levels of risk are estimated. In this review, we look at the literature on human impacts of climate change through the lens of adaptive capacity. Building on evidence of impacts on financial resources as presented in the Working Group 2 (WG2) report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6), we here present the methodology behind this review and complement it with an analysis of climatic risks to human resources. Based on our review, we argue that climate change itself adds to adaptation constraints and limits. We show that for more realistic assessments of sectoral climate risks, assumed levels of future adaptive capacity should - and can - be usefully constrained in assessments that rely on expert judgment, and propose avenues for doing so."
10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.137194,"In recent years, with the worsening of the global climate problem, the issue of CO2 emissions has gradually attracted people's attention. Accurately predicting CO2 emissions and analyzing its change trends arc important elements in addressing climate issues at this stage. Although the predecessors have clone a lot of research on CO2 emissions and also established some prediction models, few people have adopted quantifiable methods to select prediction indicators and studied the CO2 emissions of commercial department. So this paper establishes a novel BP neural network prediction model based on the index quantization ability of random forest and performance optimization ability of PSO. For further strengthening the prediction accuracy, several improvements have been made to PSO. Finally, the validity of the model is tested using panel data from 1997 to 2017 of the Chinese commercial sector. The results as follows: (1) Compared with other parallel models, the newly established hybrid forecasting model can more accurately predict the CO2 emissions of China's commercial department. (2) The prediction indexes selected after quantification based on the random forest can improve the prediction accuracy. (3) These improvements of PSO in this paper can greatly enhance the prediction effect of the hybrid prediction model. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
10.1016/j.ecolecon.2022.107564,"The study estimates the impact of the 2009/2010 drought in southwestern China on industrial outcomes and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. We focus on the outputs of the power and energy-intensive sectors and investigate the substitution of thermal power for hydropower during this extreme drought. Panel data for 93,830 firms from 2006 to 2013 were used to examine their responses to this extreme climatic event. We find that severe drought reduced hydropower production as well as the economic output of energy-intensive sectors, while it increased the power production of thermal power firms. As a result, the net CO2 emissions in the southwest increased by 6,704,364 tons, about 0.64% increase of the total regional CO2 emissions each year from 2009 to 2013. These findings suggest that climate disasters may increase carbon emissions, thereby contributing to climate change."
10.1088/1748-9326/abe5d8,"Integrated assessment models (IAMs) have emerged as key tools for building and assessing long term climate mitigation scenarios. Due to their central role in the recent IPCC assessments, and international climate policy analyses more generally, and the high uncertainties related to future projections, IAMs have been critically assessed by scholars from different fields receiving various critiques ranging from adequacy of their methods to how their results are used and communicated. Although IAMs are conceptually diverse and evolved in very different directions, they tend to be criticised under the umbrella of 'IAMs'. Here we first briefly summarise the IAM landscape and how models differ from each other. We then proceed to discuss six prominent critiques emerging from the recent literature, reflect and respond to them in the light of IAM diversity and ongoing work and suggest ways forward. The six critiques relate to (a) representation of heterogeneous actors in the models, (b) modelling of technology diffusion and dynamics, (c) representation of capital markets, (d) energy-economy feedbacks, (e) policy scenarios, and (f) interpretation and use of model results."

To this end we assemble a cross-country panel data set that allows us to estimate the determinants of urbanization. The results of our econometric analysis suggest that climatic change, as proxied by rainfall, has acted to change urbanization in sub-Saharan Africa but not elsewhere in the developing world. Moreover, this link has become stronger since decolonization, which is likely due to the often simultaneous lifting of legislation prohibiting the free internal movement of native Africans.

To systematically sort out and analyse the development history of carbon footprint research, a keyword co-appearance and literature co-citation knowledge mapping has been drawn, the carbon footprint research hotspots, knowledge bases, research frontiers, and research features have been analysed, from Web of Science core database since 2008 as a data source. From the review, by establishing a carbon footprint research framework from the perspectives of both government and market, the problems of regional environmental governance efficiency, fairness mechanisms, and carbon emission rights are analysed under the government-led and market-led approaches and reviewed the development of carbon footprint research methods. In addition, the boundary and the applicability of the carbon footprint accounting methods has been discussed. The results show: (1) China is increasingly becoming an ideal for carbon footprint research due to its varied and complicated problem of climate and environment (2) Future research hotspots will focus more on carbon sinks, land use changes, energy consumption, industrial ecology, buildings, livestock, and international trade. (3) Half-life, burst, and centrality indicate that the knowledge bases of carbon footprint are the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emissions Scenarios, ISO14040 (2006) and Livestock's long shadow. (4) The latest international fronts of carbon footprint research focus on the carbon footprint generated in international trade, innovations of methods and discrimination and definition of the theory concept, for example, the expression of carbon footprint means the use of either ecological land area units or physical weight units. (4) The research features are mainly concerned with the carbon footprint application of the multi-region input-output model in international trade, multi-scale assessment of human impact on the environment and sustainable development, and resource-environment effects associated with food loss and waste."
10.1002/mde.4467,"To achieve the goal of peak carbon dioxide emissions and carbon neutrality, China has proposed significant measures to promote green technological innovation. Though abundant research has confirmed the positive impact of green innovation on the environment, whether environmental factors reciprocally influence green innovation remains insufficiently explored. This study delves into the influence of extreme temperatures on urban green innovation, utilizing panel data from 287 prefecture-level cities in China spanning from 2003 to 2019. Results indicate that extreme temperatures significantly impede the development of urban green innovation, with a series of robustness tests affirming the reliability of this effect. We find that this effect is transmitted through both the inequality exacerbation effect and the industrial production inhibition effect. In addition, the dampening effect is more pronounced in cities in the eastern part of the country, in smaller cities, and in cities with low river densities. This paper further finds that extreme heat is the main factor that causes extreme temperature to inhibit green innovation in cities. Moreover, extreme temperatures also had a consistent inhibitory effect on the overall innovation capacity of cities."

In this setting, CCEP suffers from a large bias when the time span (T) of the dataset is fixed. We develop a bias-corrected CCEP estimator that is consistent as the number of cross-sectional units (N) tends to infinity, for T fixed or growing large, provided that the specification is augmented with a sufficient number of cross-sectional averages, and lags thereof. Monte Carlo experiments show that the correction offers strong improvements in terms of bias and variance.

While there are similarities between how E-BCA is utilized, there are significant differences too, many of whichmirror ongoing debates and recent developments in the literature on environmental and natural resource economics. We review the use of E-BCA in both countries across three themes: (a) the role of long-term discounting, (b) the estimation and use of carbon valuation, and (c) the estimation and use of the value of a statistical life. In each case, we discuss how academic developments are (and are not) translated into practical use and draw comparative lessons. We find that, in some cases, practical differences in E-BCA can be overstated, although in others these seem more substantive. Advances in the academic frontier also raise the question of when and how to update practical E-BCA, with very different answers across our themes."
10.1057/s41599-023-01992-5,"Improving regional carbon efficiency is significant for achieving carbon emission peak and carbon neutrality. Local governments' carbon reduction regulations to improve regional carbon efficiency greatly influence the macro environment of enterprise production and operation. However, only some studies have focused on the relationship between regional carbon efficiency and corporate production and operation. Based on the data of Chinese A-share listed companies from 2008 to 2019, this study aims to identify the impact and influencing mechanism of regional carbon efficiency on corporate cash holdings. The main results are as follows. (1) With the improvement of regional carbon efficiency, the cash holdings level of enterprises can be reduced. The reason is that facing the dual tasks of reducing carbon emissions and promoting economic growth, the uncertainty of China's local government's carbon reduction policy will be more obvious. This is bound to have uncertain impacts on enterprises in many aspects, resulting in local enterprises facing carbon risk. Regional carbon efficiency will reduce carbon risk and weaken the preventive motivation of enterprises holding cash under the condition of stabilizing enterprise cash flow, alleviating financing constraints and improving the availability of external funds. (2) Regional carbon efficiency reduces the cash holdings of enterprises by improving corporate debt financing capability and promoting long-term investment. That is because improvements in regional carbon efficiency can reduce the carbon risks faced by enterprises. In terms of cash source, it can alleviate the financing constraints of enterprises, while in terms of cash destination, it may promote enterprises to make long-term investments and reduce cash holdings. This study enriches the literature on the factors influencing corporate cash holdings, documents the initiative of Chinese enterprises to participate in peak carbon programs and carbon neutral actions, and may enhance support for carbon emissions reduction in developing countries."

10.1016/j.energy.2021.120514,"The whole community have paid a lot of attention to whether China can achieve its emission target. The paper adds to the existing literature on emission forecast by considering consumption preference, knowledge capital and technological innovation mechanism with in a non-linear multi-agent inter temporal optimization model (NL-MIOM) which can further improve the accuracy of CO2 emission prediction. The historical fitting test shows that the MAPE value of NL-MIOM model is 1.81%, which is lower than the GM, NGM, ARIMA, OGM, SVR and BR-AGM models. By using this model, we forecast the CO2 emissions and energy consumption structure in China under different scenarios from 2018 to 2035. We find that China's CO2 emissions will peak around 2032, 2029 or 2027 with 12.34, 11.59 or 11.17 billion tons CO2 emissions under the benchmark scenario, Preference A (American consumption preference) scenario and Preference B (Japanese consumption preference) scenario. Based on the methodology of LMDI decomposition, we identify the main factors affecting China's CO2 emissions. The results show that the technical progress is the main reason for the reduction of CO2 emissions in the historical stage, pre peak stage and post-peak stage. Moreover, we also forecast the energy use of 14 different industries in China under different scenarios. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
