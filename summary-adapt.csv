The analysis uses comparative scenario analysis with RCPs 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5 to project grain production losses with and without adaptation, considering temperature and precipitation changes for 2050 and 2100.","The benefits of adaptation are quantified by comparing projected grain production losses under different climate change scenarios (RCPs) with and without adaptation measures, using a sequence of models: a climate model, an econometric model (linking climate to crop yields), and a multi-sectoral economic model (GRACE) to estimate economic impacts on grain self-sufficiency. This comparison highlights the reduction in grain production losses attributable to adaptation.","The paper quantifies adaptation costs indirectly by simulating the impact of climate change on grain self-sufficiency, both with and without adaptation measures, under different climate scenarios (RCPs). It uses a sequence of interconnected models: a climate model (CMIP5), an econometric model to estimate climate change impacts on crop yields (Moore et al., 2018), and a multi-sectoral economic model (GRACE) using GTAP data. The analysis estimates grain production losses (rice, wheat, and maize) under different temperature and precipitation scenarios, providing a basis to assess the benefits of adaptation in terms of reduced losses. The difference in outcomes between scenarios with and without adaptation can be interpreted as the avoided costs (or benefits) of adaptation.

Adaptation can mitigate losses. Some countries (Peru, Japan, Korea, Armenia, Sweden, Latvia) may benefit in certain scenarios (RCP8.5, 2100). Direct climate change impacts on land productivity are considerable, particularly for maize, wheat, and rice, but production effects often offset these. Grain self-sufficiency rates and consumption are projected to change, requiring increased grain imports in some cases. All regions benefit from increased grain prices, especially farmers in the USA, China, India, and Pakistan. Russia may suffer the most in terms of self-sufficiency, while the USA and India may see the greatest output losses.

Research from CIAT and EMBRAPA is incorporated, particularly regarding sugarcane adaptation. The analysis projects impacts of temperature and precipitation changes on crops by calculating the percentage of current cropland area affected. The analysis also uses the PRECIS regional climate model runs.

Colombian agriculture, particularly smallholders, is highly vulnerable to extreme weather events, leading to potential yield reductions and increased production costs, especially for niche crops like coffee and sugarcane. While increased atmospheric CO2 might offer some mitigation, substantial governmental support, research, and agricultural insurance are crucial for effective adaptation. Adaptation strategies can offset negative impacts, particularly for rice and sugarcane, however, transversal measures across all sectors are required. Impacts vary significantly across crops, influenced by changing temperature and rainfall patterns, highlighting the need for targeted adaptation plans. Colombia's National Development Plan includes a framework for a National Adaptation Plan.","Synopsis: A study evaluating climate change impacts on Colombia's vulnerable agricultural sector, particularly smallholders, and proposing adaptation measures. It emphasizes a multidisciplinary approach, data collection, R&D, technology transfer, and agricultural insurance. The analysis, based on DANE (2007) and IDEAM (2001) data using the SRES-A2 emissions scenario and multiple GCMs, quantifies cropland affected by crop. It highlights the importance of governmental support, adaptation subsidies, regional climate modeling, and climate change impact assessment investments, acknowledging uncertainty in modeling inter-annual variability and extreme events. The study provides spatially distributed climate change predictions and variability across Colombia.",1.0,

Market divestment from precarious coastal properties is possible. Traditional unidirectional approaches to coastal management are insufficient; feedback loops, exemplified by beach nourishment, are critical. Holistic management is needed to prevent resource depletion and economic disparities. Disbelief in climate models exacerbates property damage and creates equity issues. Increased storm magnitude reduces the time to abandonment and raises cumulative damage. Nourishment subsidies extend abandonment time but also increase overall damage. Belief in predictive models decreases both abandonment time and damage under high sea-level rise. Physical, policy, and psychological factors contribute to systemic instability. Developed coastlines and resort economies are susceptible to boom-and-bust cycles tied to barrier island abandonment. Hazard mitigation focused on small-scale storms can inadvertently worsen the impact of large storm events, while even moderate development can reduce erosion.","The agent-based model simulates coastal homeowners' behavior on developed barrier islands under sea-level rise and subsidy scenarios, focusing on abandonment, damage, and the timing of systemic instability. It incorporates heterogeneous economic agents (developers, hotel owners, tourists) and a policy agent enacting beach nourishment based on cost-benefit analysis.

FrEDI is driven by 10,000 probabilistic scenarios of global greenhouse gas emissions (CO2, CH4, N2O), US population, and US GDP from the Resources for the Future–Socioeconomic Projections (RFF-SPs). Emission trajectories are input to the Finite Amplitude Impulse Response (FaIR) model (v1.6.2) to project global mean surface temperature, which then drives FrEDI to calculate climate-driven damages. CONUS temperature is estimated as 1.42 times global temperature, and a semi-empirical approach is used for sea level rise impacts. Sector-specific, temperature-binned damage functions are extrapolated to account for the full range of temperature scenarios. The analysis calculates marginal climate-driven damages as the difference between baseline and perturbed cases, discounting these to the year of emissions and aggregating across the time series into a net present damage estimate, often using Ramsey discounting calibrated to a near-term target discount rate of 2%. While some analyses focus on impacts through 2090, others extend projections to 2300, using techniques like extrapolating damage functions, adjusting damages based on GDP per capita, and holding adjustments constant at 2090 levels.

Uncertainty in damage estimates increases over time, while lower discount rates result in higher valuations of climate change damage.","The analysis, focusing on climate change impacts within the contiguous US (CONUS), employs the FrEDI model across 20 sectors with damage functions tailored to each sector, region, and GCM, using 2020 US dollars. It considers reactive, reasonably anticipated adaptation, or no additional adaptation, and incorporates distributional effects across vulnerable populations. A 3% discount rate is used for private consumption impacts. Damage estimates are sensitive to adaptation scenarios, underlying damage functions (including parametric uncertainty), socioeconomic drivers, and temperature projections. The study acknowledges potential double-counting and compounding effects, such as power outages exacerbating temperature-related mortality, and limitations including the omission of non-market sectors, tipping elements, and climate-induced migration in population projections. Uncertainty in GDP, population, and climate parameters are included in confidence intervals, but not sectoral parametric or structural uncertainty. A global perspective is needed when evaluating policies related to global pollutants, but this analysis is limited to CONUS.

Climate scenarios, often from the HadCM3 model, project conditions for 2020 and 2050, using 1960-1990 as a baseline. Crop modeling, specifically using APSIM and CERES-Wheat, is prominent for evaluating the effect of climate change on crop yields (soybean, wheat). Statistical analyses are used, including parametric methods, locally weighted regression (LOWESS) for rainfall, structural break analysis, Markov chains for dry/wet spells, and analysis of coefficient of variation (CV) to assess rainfall variability. Time series analysis involving ARIMA and SARIMA models is used for forecasting temperature, humidity, and precipitation. Remote sensing data is utilized to map apple orchards and terrain parameters. Hydrological modeling uses MIKE SHE coupled with remote sensing and GIS for water resource assessment. Panel data quantile regressions, log-linear regressions, and fixed effects models examine the impact of climate variables on agricultural productivity. Scenario analysis involves simulating uniform temperature increases and rainfall changes. The impacts of adaptation measures such as rubber dams are assessed through comparing crop yields before and after implementation. Water demand projections extend to 2050.","The benefits of adaptation are quantified using simulation models, such as the APSIM and DSSAT, to assess the impact of climate change on crop yields and explore adaptation options. Adaptation benefits are measured by comparing crop productivity and economic returns before and after implementing adaptation measures, such as changing sowing dates, plant density, or infrastructure like rubber dams. Quantitative methods include regression analyses, panel data approaches, and stochastic models (e.g., ARIMA) for forecasting climate variables and assessing their correlation with agricultural productivity.","The costs of adaptation are quantified using various modeling techniques, including simulation models like APSIM and CERES-Wheat for evaluating crop yield under climate scenarios (Pages 55-63), ARIMA models for forecasting climate variables (Pages 84-90), and water resource modeling like MIKE SHE for assessing groundwater fluctuations (Page 222). These methodologies simulate impacts of climate change on agricultural yields and water resources, allowing for the testing and optimization of adaptation strategies such as altering sowing dates, crop densities, or implementing infrastructure like rubber dams (Pages 106-110). The models are calibrated with historical data and validated to predict future scenarios, providing a basis for estimating adaptation costs relative to benefits across different scenarios and regions.","The analysis relies on both ex-ante modeling (climate scenarios, crop simulations, forecasting) and ex-post observations (historical rainfall analysis, structural break analysis, impact of rubber dams, panel data analysis of weather and agricultural outcomes).","The document discusses adaptation planning/decision-making primarily through the lens of agricultural adaptation to climate change. This includes: 1) the use of climate scenarios and crop models (APSIM, CERES-Wheat) to evaluate the impact of climate change on crop yields and to explore adaptation options like changing sowing dates and plant density; 2) analysis of historical rainfall data to understand trends, variability, and drought patterns; 3) forecasting temperature and precipitation using ARIMA/SARIMA models; 4) the implementation and impact assessment of specific adaptation measures like rubber dams; 5) analysis of farmer cropping patterns and information sources; and 6) econometric modeling of the impact of climate variables on crop productivity. The document also briefly touches upon water resource modeling and projections of water demand.","Based on the provided document snippets, there's no explicit quantification of the benefits of ""soft options"" (informational and institutional interventions). However, the research touches upon elements that *support* such interventions by establishing their need or providing tools for their effective design:

*   **Climate and Yield Modeling (Pages 55, 56, 58, 59, 61, 62, 63):** Crop models like APSIM and CERES-Wheat can assess the impacts of climate change on yields, informing farmers about potential risks and optimal adaptation strategies (e.g., sowing dates, plant density). This informs *informational interventions*.
*   **Rainfall and Climate Analysis (Pages 42, 44, 45, 50, 84, 86, 90, 112, 115, 117, 118, 119, 193, 194):** Statistical analysis and forecasting of rainfall patterns help understand climate variability and drought risk, enabling better preparedness and informing agricultural planning and water management. This informs both *informational and institutional interventions*.
*   **Remote Sensing (Page 95):** Remote sensing for mapping agricultural land helps monitor crop health and water resources, facilitating targeted interventions and resource allocation.
*   **Farmer Surveys (Page 129):** Understanding farmer cropping patterns and information sources is crucial for designing effective extension services and information dissemination strategies. This directly supports *informational interventions*.
*   **Water Resource Management (Pages 106, 108, 109, 110, 209, 222, 233):** Studies on rubber dams and water demand projections help inform water management policies and infrastructure development, supporting agricultural productivity and resilience. These can be *institutional interventions*.
*   **Impact Assessment (Pages 163, 164, 166, 171, 172, 173, 176, 183, 186, 187):** Studies examining the impact of climate variables on crop productivity are crucial for identifying vulnerable regions and developing targeted adaptation strategies.

In essence, the research provides the *foundation* for understanding the *need* and designing effective ""soft options,"" but it does not *directly* quantify the economic or fiscal benefits of those interventions themselves. Page 249 references the need for research on crop-weather relations, suggesting that a gap exists in research that would help quantify the benefits.","This document does not provide a clear, overarching definition of ""sufficient adaptation levels"" or ""well-adapted."" It focuses on analyzing climate change impacts (primarily on agriculture in India) using various modelling and statistical techniques. Adaptation measures are explored (e.g., changing sowing dates, rubber dams), and their impacts are assessed through simulations or comparing outcomes before and after implementation, but no single, universally applicable threshold for ""sufficient adaptation"" is defined. The closest proxy would be analyzing crop yields/farmer returns before and after implementing certain adaptation strategies.","Climate change poses substantial macroeconomic and macro-fiscal risks, particularly through its impact on agriculture, which challenges food and nutritional security. Projected effects include a significant decrease in cereal productivity and enhanced crop water needs by 2050, particularly affecting rainfed areas. Temperature increases hasten crop maturity and reduce yields in major crops like wheat and soybean, with impacts varying across regions. Climatic shifts, such as altered rainfall and increased temperature variability, are observed in critical agricultural areas like Orissa, Uttar Pradesh, and the Northwest Himalayas, affecting crop production and increasing the incidence of extreme weather events. Rubber dams and agricultural diversification are effective adaptation strategies, enhancing productivity and farmer incomes, while weather insurance and public investment in research are vital for adaptation readiness. A need exists for sustainable water resource management in light of climate-induced changes, necessitating blending traditional knowledge with advanced technologies. Changes in temperature and rainfall patterns also affect geographic pest distribution, with ramifications on agricultural outputs, warranting further research and collaborative efforts for effective adaptation.","The material primarily focuses on climate change impacts on Indian agriculture, including regional and crop-specific vulnerabilities (rice, wheat, soybean, apples), water resource management, and potential adaptation strategies (crop diversification, adjusted sowing dates, drought-resistant cultivars, rubber dams, ICTs, wasteland development). Key themes include rainfall variability and declining trends (particularly in central and eastern India), increasing temperatures, changing crop water requirements, groundwater decline (especially in Rajasthan and hard rock regions of Maharashtra), and glacial retreat in the Himalayas impacting river flows. The research emphasizes the need for improved information access, community awareness, and agricultural diversification. While adaptation strategies are discussed, direct links to national-level macroeconomic or macro-fiscal risks, costs, and benefits are generally not explicitly explored, with a few exceptions, but it is mentioned how crop yields, including the impact of government initiatives and natural calamities, influence such outcomes. Developing countries like India are noted as more vulnerable due to fragile environments and lower coping capacity.",1.0,

It employs the coupled ADCIRC+SWAN model to simulate storm surge and wave inundation, both currently and under future sea-level rise scenarios (2050), for specific storm events. SLAMM (Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model) is used to project land cover changes, particularly transformations in coastal wetlands and marshes, due to SLR. A 'damages avoided' method compares flood damages with and without the presence of natural habitats, utilizing parcel-level property data and depth-damage functions. The methodology incorporates land use and land cover information from the C-CAP database to represent wetlands and their dissipation effects in the hydrodynamic model. The spatially explicit analysis is applied to three coastal counties in New Jersey, adjacent to the Jacques Cousteau National Estuarine Research Reserve (JCNERR). Additional approaches mentioned for broader analysis include the DIVA Wetland Change Model, choice experiments, and field-based numerical modelling of wave propagation across marshes.","The benefits of adaptation, specifically natural habitat preservation, are quantified by estimating avoided flood damages to residential properties. This is done by simulating flood events using the ADCIRC+SWAN model under two scenarios: one where natural habitats (coastal wetlands and marshes) are present, and one where they are absent. The difference in flood damages between the two scenarios, calculated using parcel-level property values and depth-damage functions, represents the economic benefit of the natural habitat in reducing flood risk. The SLAMM model projects future habitat changes due to sea-level rise, allowing for benefits to be assessed under future climate scenarios.","The study quantifies adaptation costs (or, more precisely, avoided damages due to the presence of natural habitats) by comparing flood damages to parcel-level property with and without those habitats. It uses the ADCIRC+SWAN model to simulate flood depths under both scenarios (habitat present vs. habitat absent) for historical and synthetic storms, incorporating sea-level rise projections from SLAMM.

It assesses this value by comparing flood damages with and without the presence of these habitats, using models like ADCIRC+SWAN and SLAMM to simulate storm surge, wave dynamics, and habitat changes. Therefore, implicitly, the paper considers adaptation as being improved by the presence and preservation of natural habitats and their ability to reduce flooding impact.","Coastal wetlands and marshes provide significant flood protection services, reducing flood depth and property damage, particularly during less intense storm events. Their protective value is estimated at millions of dollars, with per-square-kilometer values ranging from $53,000 to $138,000.

The analysis also frequently addresses direct economic losses from hurricanes, with specific focus on coastal regions and infrastructure (pages 368, 369, 371, 374, 375, 376, 377, 378, 381), indicating that sectors related to coastal real estate, tourism, and construction/infrastructure are significantly impacted. Finally, several analyses focus on the impact of hurricanes on Louisiana and housing service production after Hurricane Katrina (pages 384, 385, 386).","Under scenarios A2, PREIND, 2CO2, and 4CO2, outcomes were analyzed.","Methodologies used include: Statistical modeling (Poisson, quantile regression, correlations analysis, wavelet analysis, network analysis, kernel density analysis, regression analysis), numerical simulations (climate models, numerical weather prediction models, cloud models), expert elicitation, downscaling techniques, cost-benefit analysis, Input-Output models (including Adaptive Regional Input-Output models), and the Emanuel hurricane model. Specific techniques mentioned are smoothing/filtering, rejection sampling, bootstrapping, sensitivity analysis, and the cyclone phase space method. Model performance is evaluated using root mean square error (RMSE). Analysis often uses IPCC AR4 coupled GCM simulations, ECMWF ERA40 reanalysis dataset, NCEP global reanalysis, and historical hurricane data. Different linking functions (linear and logarithmic) are applied in statistical models. Direct losses are assessed using physical models (exposure and vulnerability) or statistical models. Indirect losses are estimated using various modeling approaches, including polynomial regression. Some studies employ synthetic hurricane tracks.","Benefits of adaptation are quantified through various economic analyses that assess direct and indirect losses from climate impacts like hurricanes. For direct losses, physical models use datasets on exposure and vulnerability to predict damage ratios, while statistical models create relationships between past hurricane data and economic losses. Indirect losses are evaluated using models like the Adaptive Regional Input-Output (ARIO) model, which accounts for production capacity changes and dynamic behavior post-disaster. Cost-benefit analyses assess infrastructure investments by comparing potential reductions in direct and indirect losses. Additionally, methodological roadmaps integrate these models to assess climate change economic impacts, including adaptation strategies.","Costs of adaptation are quantified through a combination of models and methodologies that evaluate both direct and indirect economic impacts of climate events like hurricanes. On the direct costs side, physical models use datasets to predict losses based on exposure, vulnerability, and hurricane characteristics, while statistical models analyze relationships between past hurricane data and economic impacts. Indirect costs are assessed using models like the Adaptive Regional Input-Output model, which estimates economic disruptions and adaptive responses following a disaster. These analyses also incorporate cost-benefit assessments to gauge infrastructure resilience, and employ downscaling techniques to link global climate changes with local impacts, aiding in the projection of future adaptation costs and strategies.","The analysis relies on both ex-ante modeling and ex-post observations. There's extensive use of statistical models and climate model simulations (ex-ante), often calibrated and validated against historical data (ex-post). The analysis also uses historical observations to establish baseline probabilities and relationships.","The extracted notes focus on modeling and predicting hurricane activity and associated economic impacts, including direct and indirect losses. Specifically in regards to adaptation planning/decision-making, the notes discuss (1) translating changes in hurricane risk into changes in direct losses and indirect economic impacts, (2) assessing the desirability of new infrastructure using cost-benefit analyses, and (3) using models to simulate the economic impact of hurricanes and assess losses in production and reconstruction needs. Further, the notes mention considering adaptation strategies in the assessment of climate change economic impacts. The analysis provides results that are considered useful for risk managers.",,"The paper does not define sufficient adaptation levels but focuses on modelling hurricane risks and economic losses, providing tools that could inform adaptation decisions aimed at minimizing those losses.","Hurricane activity is influenced by various factors, including SSTs, sunspot numbers, windshear, aerosols, and large-scale climate patterns like ENSO and NAO. While some models suggest a potential reduction in overall tropical cyclone (TC) frequency under increased CO2, others predict increased intensity and rainfall, particularly in specific regions. Model coherence on TC genesis response to climate change is lacking, reflecting differing SST response patterns. There's a potential risk of TC development over the Mediterranean Sea. Uncertainty in future climate poses challenges for adaptation, and adaptation measures can have unintended consequences. Increased hurricane intensity amplifies potential losses, particularly indirect losses, highlighting the importance of resilient economies and efficient reconstruction. The most intense hurricanes (Cat 2-5) in the US are projected to increase in annual probability of landfall, particularly Cat 5 hurricanes, placing some regions, like New Orleans, at elevated risk. The nonlinear increase in losses and the significance of indirect costs must be considered in climate change response strategies.","Understanding tropical cyclone activity and its implications is critical, particularly in the Caribbean, Mexico, and the U.S. Reliable historical records of hurricanes form the basis for analyzing the social and economic importance in these regions. Cyclones' intensity can be linked to solar activity, SSTs, and windshear, with predictions often hindered by model limitations. Regional shifts in landfall probabilities suggest potential changes in economic impacts, requiring consideration of indirect alongside direct losses. Adaptation strategies can mitigate these losses, although their quantitative effects are challenging to determine. Urbanization and economic resilience are significant, influencing recovery post-disaster. The insurance sector is impacted by cyclone predictions, affecting premiums and capital requirements. Uncertainties in climate models and economic predictions highlight the need for comprehensive multi-model analyses to assess risk management and adaptation strategies effectively. The paper suggests the importance of 'no-regret' adaptations in the face of uncertain long-term climate impacts.",1.0,"There is no information about the benefits of ""soft options"" in the text provided."

These models relate net crop income to climate variables, controlling for household characteristics and spatial climate variations. Data was collected through field surveys in 2017, covering the 2015-16 cropping seasons. The models can explain 3-16% of the observed variations in net crop income. Future climate impacts are estimated using two AOGCMs (BNU-ESM and CanESM2) under the RCP8.5 pathway for the periods 2021-2060 and 2061-2100. Additionally, computable general equilibrium and whole farm models are used to assess climate-crop physiology and development, incorporating adaptation strategies like adjusted planting dates, variety selection, and fertilizer use.","Adaptation benefits are quantified using models such as the Ricardian model, computable general equilibrium models, and whole farm models. The Ricardian model, for instance, evaluates the economic impacts of climate change on agriculture by estimating the relationship between net crop income and climate variables, capturing long-term farm productivity through land rents.

It uses Ricardian regression models to assess the relationship between climate variables and net crop income, and considers adaptation strategies like changing planting dates, variety selection, and fertilizer use within computable general equilibrium and whole farm models. The effectiveness of adaptation is gauged by its ability to offset the negative impacts of climate change on net crop income as projected by climate models.","Climate change impacts on crop yields can be both positive and negative, particularly affecting agriculture-dependent economies. In Bangladesh, net crop income is climate-sensitive, with temperature increases potentially beneficial where irrigation is available. While crop-specific models have limitations, Ricardian models account for farmer adaptation. Climate variables exhibit a nonlinear relationship with net crop incomes, and farmers use strategies like new varieties, adjusted sowing dates, and crop diversification. Temperature and rainfall significantly impact net crop incomes, with farm size and irrigation access having positive effects. Higher temperatures in Bangladesh can increase net crop incomes due to irrigation and more cropping seasons; rainfall increases are generally beneficial. Future climate changes will cause varied regional impacts on net crop incomes, potentially increasing income due to adaptation. Net crop income is more elastic to temperature changes than rainfall, exhibiting seasonal and spatial variations.","Synopsis: A study focusing on Bangladesh agriculture identifies a research gap in assessing the economic impacts of climate change on overall crop farming. Using disproportionate stratified random sampling across 7 climatic zones, the study investigates complex relationships between temperature, rainfall, and crop income, revealing both benefits and drawbacks of temperature changes within growing seasons.
