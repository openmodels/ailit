It includes comparisons of BAU and optimal abatement scenarios within economic models DICE-2016 and CDICE, and explores the impact of varying equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) and carbon cycle calibrations.","The methodology involves calibrating and evaluating climate emulators (CEs) used in integrated assessment models (IAMs) like DICE-2016, with a focus on aligning them with climate science benchmarks (CMIP). This includes independent calibration of carbon cycle and temperature models, using benchmark data and extreme cases for calibration targets. The analysis re-calibrates the DICE-2016 model (""CDICE"") and compares its performance to the original, examining the impact of different climate calibrations (e.g., HadGEM2-ES, GISS-E2-R), climate sensitivity (ECS), and emission scenarios on the social cost of carbon (SCC) and optimal mitigation strategies. Different damage functions, carbon cycle models, and economic parameters (e.g., growth-adjusted interest rate, intertemporal elasticity of substitution) are used in stylized exercises. The analysis considers both partial and general equilibrium effects, and explores miscalibration impacts, comparing results under BAU and optimal abatement scenarios with varying time horizons. The CE's physics are considered, contrasting box-model and impulse response function (IRF) formulations.","Key findings relate to the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) and the performance of climate-economic models, particularly DICE-2016. The choice of parameters in climate emulators significantly impacts the predicted SCC, highlighting the importance of considering model uncertainty, especially concerning Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) and Transient Climate Response (TCR). DICE-2016 is seriously flawed as it fails to reproduce CO2 and temperature evolution accurately. Its climate module is miscalibrated, leading to an SCC that is oversensitive to the discount rate and underestimates optimal carbon taxes, resulting in temperature responses outside expected ranges. Compensating errors exist within DICE-2016. The functional form of damage functions (including higher-order terms) significantly affects the impact of climate model uncertainty on the SCC. Varying only the ECS parameter is insufficient for capturing full climate model uncertainty, leading to SCC underestimation. Different reasonable climate model calibrations lead to vastly different predictions for CO2 concentrations, temperatures, and damages. Optimal emissions are predicted to exceed RCP26, surpassing the Paris limit. DICE-2016 overestimates carbon and initially underestimates temperature increases compared to other calibrations and leads to larger damages and higher temperatures but similar SCC due to discounting. The SCC is highly sensitive to the growth-adjusted interest rate and the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (IES).","This research emphasizes the recalibration of climate emulators within Integrated Assessment Models, focusing primarily on the DICE model, using CMIP5 data for improved accuracy. It highlights the significance of accurately aligning economic models with climate data to better understand climate change costs and scenarios. Structural flaws in DICE-2016's temperature equations and carbon cycle partially offset each other, affecting the model's outputs. Findings suggest that temperature calibration impacts outweigh those of carbon cycle calibration on predictions of damages. The speed of warming impacts the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) more than long-term temperature forecasts, and the SCC aligns with an optimal carbon tax under specific conditions. The analysis indicates that miscalibrations can yield different projections and policy recommendations, stressing limitations of climate emulators in capturing complex feedbacks. Discounting and interest rate assumptions are key in understanding long-term climate-economic interactions.

These models incorporate features such as heterogeneous agents, incomplete financial markets, and distinct shocks (dirty energy usage, climate sensitivity, damage function parameters). A key element is modeling climate change with components from Golosov et al. (2014)'s carbon cycle and Weitzman (2012)'s tipping point damage function. Uncertainty is introduced through random walks with reflecting barriers for parameters like dirty energy share, climate sensitivity, and tipping points. Solution methods include projection methods (Marcet (1988) et al., Krusell and Smith (1998), Kubler and Scheidegger (2019)), grid search, and simulation-based methods using Gaussian processes and Monte Carlo simulations (with simulations often running for 500 years/100 periods or longer). Policy options explored include time-invariant and carbon-dependent carbon taxes with various revenue redistribution schemes, aiming to maintain expected utility across generations. Scenarios are evaluated using metrics like utility and certainty equivalents. Both deterministic and stochastic models are used, with analysis focusing on outcomes after 100-200 years for generations born after policy implementation.","Highlights: Climate change poses significant macroeconomic and macro-fiscal risks, primarily impacting future generations through reduced consumption and increased probability of climate disasters (potentially reducing GDP by up to 30%). These disasters are often driven by skewed damage distributions, tipping points (e.g., at 3°C temperature increase), and energy-usage shocks, exacerbated by uncertainty in climate sensitivity and damage functions. Pareto-improving carbon taxation, particularly CO2-dependent taxes and generational redistribution of revenue, can substantially mitigate these risks. Optimal carbon taxes raise future generations’ expected utilities (e.g., by up to 4%) and dramatically lower the probability of crossing calamitous climate tipping points (e.g., from 9% to 1%), while maintaining current generations' welfare. A 25% tax on dirty energy can generate welfare gains. However, policy design must account for the non-stationarity of the economy, the impact of rare events, and the potential for high carbon taxes to trigger consumption disasters if imposed after CO2 concentrations reach critical levels. In the absence of risk, there is essentially no scope or need for policy. Climate uncertainty can, paradoxically, necessitate lower carbon tax rates due to increased precautionary savings.","The study presents a model analyzing macroeconomic risks of climate change while focusing on the volatility encountered in an economy's transition path. Key findings include that optimal carbon-risk tax policies aim to minimize reaching climate tipping points while ensuring Pareto improvements are achieved, maintaining utility for current generations. This carbon-risk taxation can be as large or larger than taxes addressing average damages. The model parallels works by Cai et al. (2013) and Nordhaus (2017), assuming an eventual decline in dirty energy dependency over 300 years and neglects secular growth for simplicity. 

CO2 emissions align with dirty energy use, tapering to zero after 120 years under the benchmark scenario. Despite this, the optimal tax doesn't fully prevent climate change or worst-case scenarios spanning up to 500 years, although damages are predicted to recover after 500 years. Long-term damages (500-1000 years) don't inherently lead to Pareto improvements due to compensation demands for current generations. 

The paper models stochastic climate sensitivity effects and examines tax implications under both certainty and uncertainty, finding significant taxes and welfare implications under uncertain conditions. For instance, in certain pathways, taxes may exceed 100% when excess temperature at a climate sensitivity of 3 reaches 2 degrees. Generation-specific revenue shares adjust in initial periods to align lifetime utility with policy-free utility, then stabilize. Distributions of temperature and damages assessed over long modeling horizons (100-200 years) illustrate the enduring impacts and uncertainties of climate outcomes.",Macroeconomic/Fiscal,,Acute shocks,Adaptive,,,Adaptive (reflecting shifts in economic behavior in response to impacts),Tipping Points,"The focus is on optimal carbon tax policies, including time-invariant and carbon-dependent taxes.

Persistent negative precipitation anomalies are identified as the most influential climate factor, significantly affecting economic productivity and increasing poverty levels. Drought specifically has a detrimental impact on agricultural and industrial GDP, posing a significant challenge to national economies and exacerbating poverty, particularly for rural populations. Climate effects are more pronounced in less diversified economies at lower latitudes. Moreover, temperature negatively correlates with GDP growth when precipitation is excluded, but it is less significant compared to drought and precipitation extremes.

It highlights the disproportionate vulnerability of SSA economies to hydroclimatic risks compared to temperature increases, emphasizing the need to prioritize drought adaptation. Rural households in SSA, heavily reliant on rainfed agriculture, face significant covariant risks from climate variability, leading to risk aversion and hindering productive investments. While micro-level studies exist (e.g., in India, Ethiopia, and Cameroon), research on the effects of hydroclimatic variability on national SSA economies is lacking. The study employs cross-country regressions and a WASP index (effective for drought, less so for floods) to analyze the impact of climate variability on macroeconomic outcomes, finding that drought has a significant and potentially lagged (1 year) negative effect on industrial GDP, possibly due to reduced hydroelectricity and agricultural production.

Specific methods include fixed effects and random effects models, with the selection between them often guided by Hausman tests. Some regressions utilize clustered and heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors. A national-level precipitation statistic is employed. The WASP index is used to differentiate drought from flooding. Lags of variables are incorporated in some models. The livelihoods measures include per capita economic growth, industrial value added to GDP, agricultural value added to GDP, and poverty headcount ratios. Climate data encompasses temperature and precipitation. The analysis spans various periods, including 1962-2003 and 1975-2003.","Persistent negative precipitation anomalies, particularly drought, serve as the most influential climate factor on economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The relative impact of climate variables, such as precipitation and temperature, differs based on a country's economic structure and sensitivity to climate change. In SSA, drought is repeatedly identified as a main detractor to both economic and agricultural GDP, contributing to increased poverty levels and impeding agricultural productivity. While temperature changes also negatively affect GDP growth, their significance often decreases when precipitation is accounted for. Hydroclimatic variability remains a significant challenge, particularly for rural households and national economies, with severe drought events correlating strongly with negative economic and welfare outcomes. This variability often acts as a barrier to bridging the economic output gap between SSA and industrialized countries, accounting for a considerable proportion of this disparity. To mitigate these impacts, enhancing economies' capacity to manage present climate challenges is critical, forming the basis for effective adaptation strategies. The analysis of these relationships indicates that extreme climate variables, like those measured by the WASP index, are more indicative of economic effects than mean temperature or precipitation values.","Synopsis: Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) may need to prioritize drought adaptation over temperature increase mitigation, as hydroclimatic risks significantly impact economic growth. Studies at village or household levels in India, Ethiopia, and Cameroon highlight microeconomic impacts of climate risk, but national-level macroeconomic and macro-fiscal outcomes are less researched for SSA. Climate's economic impact varies by study scale, with case studies in SSA indicating a dominant negative effect, particularly affecting rural households and agricultural investments. Research gaps exist regarding hydroclimatic variability's effects on SSA national economies. Cross-country regressions using the WASP index (which captures spatial rainfall variability and drought) show that drought negatively affects industrial GDP, potentially due to reduced hydroelectricity and poor agricultural production. While precipitation positively relates to industrial GDP, this could stem from hydroelectricity or agricultural inputs. Flood risk, however, had insignificant results, indicating the need for improved flood data. Drought effects are stronger with a one-year lag, suggesting delays in agriculture to secondary industry propagation. The vulnerability of SSA's rainfed agriculture-dependent rural populations exacerbates poverty. The study utilizes fixed and random effects regressions to control for country-specific characteristics, with the choice dependent on the regression type.",Macroeconomic/Fiscal,Econometric,Acute shocks,Adaptive,Regional,,Transitional (accounting for changes over time),,"Hydroclimatic variability (precipitation, drought, flooding) is used in econometric analyses (cross-country and panel regressions) to model its effect on economic growth and welfare outcomes (e.g., per capita economic growth, industrial value added, poverty headcounts) at the national level, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Instead, it uses historical data (1980-2008) on climate-related natural disasters (tropical cyclones and floods) and socioeconomic factors to analyze adaptation efficiency. The analysis is based on regressions with various control variables rather than specific, named scenarios.","The study utilizes a comprehensive methodology combining panel data from the Munich Re natural catastrophe database and various regression techniques to examine countries' adaptation efficiency to climate disasters like tropical cyclones and floods. The theoretical framework links income and disaster loss, framing adaptation as a consumption choice between climate security and other goods. It incorporates representative household utility and profit maximization models for climate security, deriving adaptation demand and supply functions to reach an equilibrium relationship with income. Empirical analysis spans multiple regressions, including OLS and negative binomial models, controlling for variables like event intensity, country exposure, income, propensity to disasters, and efficiency factors such as institutional quality and education. The methodology examines socio-economic and political influences on disaster outcomes, including fatalities and economic damages, using significance levels and accounting for country-specific factors through clustered standard errors. Cross-sectional, panel, and stochastic frontier analyses are encrypted in the study approach, with emphasis on identifying predictors of disaster resilience and efficiency spill-overs, providing insights into national adaptation needs.","Highlights:

*   An adaptation deficit, disproportionately affecting poorer countries, arises from both income and efficiency factors. Addressing it requires inclusive growth policies and targeted adaptation support, especially where inefficiencies are high.
*   Higher GDP per capita is generally associated with lower disaster deaths and economic damages, while higher income inequality often increases fatalities.
*   Effective disaster management is linked to strong institutions, higher government expenditure as a percentage of GDP, and lower political and socioeconomic risks.
*   The impact of various socioeconomic factors, including trade openness, credit to GDP ratio, and institutional quality, on disaster losses can vary depending on the disaster type (floods vs. cyclones) and model specifications.
*   Disaster magnitude and population size are significant predictors of disaster losses (deaths and economic damages). Land mass tends to reduce deaths and economic damages in cyclone events.
*   Country-specific factors are important; some countries perform better or worse than expected given their income levels.
*   Economic growth and rational decisions can outpace adaptation efforts.
*   Disaster magnitude, population, and GDP per capita are major drivers of flood deaths, while Gini coefficient increases flood deaths and government expenditure reduces flood deaths.
*   Disaster magnitude and population size are major drivers of tropical cyclone deaths, while larger area, higher GDP per capita, higher cyclone propensity, and higher government expenditure all tend to decrease deaths, and the Gini coefficient tends to increase cyclone deaths.
*   Disaster magnitude and total GDP are major drivers of flood and cyclone economic damages, while larger area and higher Life Expectancy tend to decrease economic damages from flood events. Several socioeconomic factors affect disaster loss prevention.","The study examines the relationship between income, climate security, and adaptation decisions, focusing on flood and tropical cyclone events. It uses the Munich Re database, acknowledging potential measurement errors in economic damage estimates. Key findings include the potential undercounting of economic losses suffered by poorer populations and the correlation between adaptive capacity for different types of events. The adaptation deficit is attributed to both demand (increased desire for security with higher income) and efficiency effects (increased adaptation productivity in wealthier nations). The analysis considers factors related to normalization (flood magnitude standardization), demand, and efficiency, but faces data limitations, excluding other climate-related disasters. Stochastic frontier analysis was deemed unsuitable due to cross-country variations and data limitations. The effect of income on sensitivity to climate events is only crudely accounted for.",Macroeconomic/Fiscal,Econometric,Acute shocks,Adaptive,Global,,Transitional (accounting for changes over time),,"Adaptation is framed as a consumption choice, specifically between climate security and other goods.

Coastal protection, primarily through dikes and beach nourishment (justified by tourism revenue), could mitigate these impacts but represents a substantial cost, potentially up to 0.02% of global GDP. Adaptation costs are largely driven by dike construction and maintenance, especially in the long term.","The likelihood of successful implementation of protection measures against climate-related risks varies by region, being lowest in small islands, Africa, and parts of Asia. There are acknowledged limitations in the understanding of sea-level rise processes, as highlighted in the IPCC AR4, due to the inability of models to reproduce rapid changes in the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets observed before that report. Monitoring sea level is crucial to detect unexpected accelerations, and improving process-based models is essential for more robust projections. Regional sea-level rise varies significantly. Socioeconomic scenarios suggest that the absence of coastward migration could exacerbate impact potential.

The analysis incorporates fiscal policy (growth rate of public expenditure) and uses bank-level microdata from China to investigate the role of banks and the credit channel in transmitting climate change impacts on monetary policy effectiveness. Methodology includes nonlinearity tests, Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) tests for stationarity, Generalized Impulse Response Functions (GIRF), and regression analysis with bank-level controls (liquidity ratio, capital ratio, total assets, shadow banking, money stock, economic growth rate) to test mechanisms. Climate change variables are sometimes transformed to quarterly frequency.","Climate change, proxied by temperature shocks, weakens the efficiency of expansionary monetary policy and amplifies the impact of contractionary policy. High temperatures impair agricultural yields, industrial output, and economic growth, all key monetary policy targets. Increased temperatures also reduce firm profitability, raise bank loan default probabilities and non-performing loan ratios, leading to climate-induced credit constraints as banks become more risk-averse in lending. Temperature shocks lead to larger fluctuations in economic outputs and lengthen divergence to steady states. The impact of monetary policy shocks on GDP differs significantly between low and high temperature regimes. Increases in temperature shocks impede bank lending and increase the non-performing loan ratio of commercial banks, with the latter fully mediating the impact of temperature shocks on monetary policy effectiveness. Central banks should consider incorporating climate change into monetary frameworks.","Synopsis: This study examines the impact of temperature shocks on monetary policy effectiveness in China, focusing on a climate-induced credit constraint mechanism.

Monetary policy is proxied by money stock growth, and fiscal policy by public expenditure growth. The results suggest that temperature shocks exacerbate credit constraints, weakening the impact of monetary policy on output.

The model considers regimes based on temperature shock thresholds and finds that output responses to monetary shocks are weaker when controlling for fiscal policy.

The models consider different damage scenarios and sensitivities, often including worst-case scenarios.","Carbon taxation, integrated with region- and generation-specific transfers, is essential to address the carbon externality effectively, necessitating global participation. Such policies can limit global temperature increases significantly, aiming for the Paris Agreement's 2.0-degree limit, although delays and incomplete participation reduce their effectiveness. Uniform Welfare Improving (UWI) and compensatory (UWIL) policies can provide welfare gains across generations and regions, though they impose future consumption losses on poorer, less responsible regions like India, Brazil, and other parts of South Asia and Africa. Despite potential short-term benefits in regions like Russia and Canada due to climate change, most regions like India, the US, China, and others face substantial GDP losses under business-as-usual scenarios. Redistribution through these policies slightly increases peak regional damages. Optimal taxation can guide the reduction of fossil fuel consumption and significantly cut regional climate damages almost by half, but determining efficient distribution of tax revenue remains challenging. The social cost of carbon typically increases over time, with considerable regional variation, indicating that some regions might experience short-term gains. Participation from major emitters like China is crucial, as are considerations for compensatory measures for significantly impacted regions. The study emphasizes the necessity of global carbon taxation and redistribution to ensure equitable welfare gains and climate damage mitigation.","This study models the macroeconomic impacts of climate change and carbon policies, focusing on regional heterogeneity and transfer policies.

Cumulative precipitation positively impacts total income. Wage inequality is driven by climate impacts on labour availability, though sectoral productivity shocks also play a role.

A mixed-effects model regresses growth rate changes against global mean temperature (GMT), testing for structural breaks. Future TC damages are projected using a statistical TC emulator based on global climate models. The SCC calculation follows Ricke et al.

Damage Assessment Data (DAD) based on income is used. Calculations are performed using a discrete time definition of discount rates and presented using software tools (Python, CLI-MADA, statsmodels).","Tropical cyclones (TCs) negatively impact economic growth in the short-, mid-, and long-term, with cumulative losses increasing over several years before stabilizing. These growth losses scale with global mean temperature change and vary significantly between countries due to differing exposure. Accounting for TC impacts substantially increases the global Social Cost of Carbon (SCC), particularly in TC-affected nations and major emitters like the USA. Lower- and middle-income countries face greater adaptation challenges relative to household income. The discount rate significantly influences SCC estimates.

The relationship between global mean temperature (GMT) and TC-induced growth rate changes is independent of SSPs but weakly dependent on RCPs. Damage estimates are based on wind fields only, neglecting rainfall and storm surge, and may overestimate future damages if adaptation measures are effective.

The core methods include Random Forests (RFs), multivariate cubic regression, and linear spline regression, sometimes complemented by Decision Trees (DT), Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), and Support Vector Regression (SVR). Panel regressions with fixed effects (cell and time) and Cobb-Douglas production functions are also employed. A common approach is to conduct a thought experiment involving a uniform temperature increase across all cells and simulating the resulting GDP changes. Model performance is evaluated using metrics like R-squared, RMSE, MAE, and AIC, with bootstrapping used to assess model robustness and prediction performance. The study also validates model performance using out-of-box (OOB) data for RFs and train-test splits, and addresses the limitations of extrapolation, particularly for RFs. Tests for serial correlation, cross-sectional independence, and heteroskedasticity are conducted.","Highlights: Studies on the macroeconomic impacts of climate change, particularly temperature rises, on national GDP in China reveal varying estimates depending on the modeling approach. Random Forests (RFs) suggest a modest 1% change in national GDP per 1°C warming, while cubic and spline regressions indicate larger changes of -3% and -6%, respectively. RFs demonstrate superior performance in terms of stability, explanatory power, and prediction accuracy within the observed temperature range, but possess limited extrapolation ability, potentially underestimating negative impacts under higher warming scenarios (e.g., 6°C). The optimal temperature for peak per capita GDP is around 15°C. The impact of temperature predominantly benefits GDP growth in northern China. Temperature and precipitation, along with their nonlinear and lagged effects, should be considered in economic projections.","This study uses subnational Chinese data, including GECON 4.0 and CORDEX East Asia climate data, to assess climate change's economic impact via Random Forest (RF) and other models. Analysis involves geographically scaled economic data (winsorized) and five-year averages, modeled using a 'cell' based approach to derive national GDP. Empirical models, covering 1985-2005, lack lagged effects and spatial autocorrelation considerations. Optimal temperatures for economic activity vary across models (15-16°C for cubic model and RFs, 21°C for spline). While lagged climate variables don't significantly improve model performance, sample size and extrapolation limitations in RFs can underestimate impacts under higher warming scenarios. Causality remains an issue for RFs, requiring validation. The study applies log-first difference to remove time trends and recommends further research using regression-enhanced RFs or neural networks to address extrapolation issues.

Technological absorption is crucial for productivity and mitigating inequality, but family farmers face barriers to innovation. Climate change also drives migration patterns from the semiarid region. Low adaptive capacity of family farmers is linked to low income, dependence on agriculture, and limited access to climate information.

Instead, it implicitly suggests that sufficient adaptation involves: (1) addressing the specific vulnerabilities of Russia, particularly concerning permafrost melt and Arctic climate change, which are inadequately represented in global IAMs; (2) improving data collection and modeling capabilities, particularly regarding economic impacts; and (3) implementing localized, knowledge-based adaptation strategies. The focus is on mitigating negative impacts and capitalizing on potential benefits (though the paper argues that benefits are often overstated in existing models).","The provided text doesn't explicitly detail the benefits of ""soft options"" like informational and institutional interventions. However, it implies that investing in data collection networks, satellite groups, geospatial data techniques, and modelling assessments (Page 13), alongside strengthening local knowledge and regional centers of competence (Page 14), are crucial for understanding and adapting to climate change. These actions can be considered ""soft options"" that lead to better policy recommendations, strategic adaptation, and economic assessment of climate change impacts.

* Agrifood system changes","MIRAGRODEP (an extension of the MIRAGE model), GLOBIOM, LIST, IMPACT suite modelling, reference scenarios of hunger trends.","The methodologies employed encompass a range of approaches, including:

*   **Modeling:** Use of dynamic global Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models like MIRAGRODEP (a multi-region, multi-sector, dynamically recursive model) and its integration with other models such as GLOBIOM (land use) and LIST (health & nutrition). Includes simulating historical shocks to assess systemic risk. Also, IMPACT suite modelling and integrated modelling frameworks to model multiple interventions.
*   **Scenario Analysis:** Developing scenarios to assess synergies among interventions, considering governance principles (e.g., land use policies) and organized around pillars like efficiency, inclusiveness, and better choices. Also dietary scenarios are assessed for their GHG mitigation potential. Projections are often carried out to 2030.
*   **Optimization:** Applying optimization programming (including the duality principle) to minimize caloric hunger (PoU) subject to constraints. Using production possibilities frontier (PPF) framework to illustrate trade-offs and optimization problems to minimize poverty or public expenditure.
*   **Cost Analysis:** Cost-benefit analysis (CBA), cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MACC) analysis, and Total Cost Assessment (TCA), including monetization of environmental externalities using restoration/compensation costs, and monetization of health losses using the value of a statistical life (VSL). Least-cost ranking of interventions. Public Expenditure Reviews.
*   **Data Analysis:** Analysis of existing datasets related to farm size and production, food prices and nutritional composition (using ICP/WFP data), agricultural research systems (H index of publications), and micro-level data on agricultural input trade. Representative household distributions are generated at the continental level based on available countries' data and reshaped to target demographic and income macroeconomic indicators where countries lack detailed household data.
*   **Literature Review & Synthesis:** Reviews of published scientific literature, semi-structured interviews, and synthesis of existing studies on agroecology, food and nutrition security interventions, and conflict impacts.
*   **Conceptual Frameworks:** Utilizing conceptual frameworks of food systems (e.g., HLPE 2017/2020) and gender roles, as well as causal linkages between climate change and food systems, including a food system compass.
*   **Digital Technologies:** Utilizing digital technologies for data collection from farmers (digital communication technology, citizen science, AI-based tools for pest/disease detection, remote sensing).","Climate change poses significant macroeconomic and macro-fiscal risks to food systems, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions, exacerbating hunger and micronutrient deficiencies. Adaptation requires a systemic approach, avoiding isolated interventions. Key aspects include:

*   **Food Security & Affordability:** A healthy diet is unaffordable for many, especially in low-income countries. Ending hunger by 2030 is achievable with structural interventions and synergies that address different causes of hunger while minimizing intervention costs. Reducing food loss/waste is beneficial. Investment in interventions can significantly reduce the cost of safety nets to ensure healthy diets. Diversification of food systems is central to building resilience. COVID-19 has amplified vulnerabilities, impacting economic growth and poverty.

*   **Economic Implications & Trade-offs:** Transformation of agrifood systems has significant macroeconomic consequences (employment, income, cost of living, fiscal impacts) and involves economy-wide trade-offs. There are trade-offs between policy objectives like food production vs. environmental sustainability. Violent conflicts negatively impact GDP per capita, especially in agriculture and food security.

*   **Intervention Strategies:** A ""Full package"" of interventions, including Safety Nets and School Feeding Programs, can significantly improve access to healthy diets. Poverty and inequality eradication requires equitable resource redistribution, quality education, progressive taxation, and infrastructure investments, empowering the poor and vulnerable. Targeted health services enhance productivity. Prioritize investments with long-term impacts (e.g., R&D, irrigation), frontloading them. The most important outcomes are the rankings of the interventions and the associated uncertainty levels for their effectiveness (people lifted out of hunger) and cost, which can help policymakers prioritize interventions based on a balance of potential impact and certainty. MACC analysis facilitates priority setting by showing the costs of lifting people out of hunger.

*   **Technological Advancements:** Technology and data are crucial for responding to pest outbreaks. Opportunity costs of excluding genome editing from agriculture are significant. Strengthening R&D efforts, especially in lagging countries, can boost agricultural productivity. Upscaling biotechnology innovations can address climate change, food security, and rural development challenges.

*   **Environmental Sustainability & Mitigation:** Reducing ruminant meat consumption and land-sparing effects offer significant mitigation potential. Regenerative agriculture has potential for carbon sequestration. Strengthen water-based ecosystems and improve agricultural water management. Climate-related risks cause significant GDP losses. GM crops improve sustainability through GHG emission reduction and increased carbon dioxide sequestration.

*   **Funding & Policy:** Ending hunger requires increased aid flows for agriculture, food, and rural development. Reallocating agricultural and fossil fuel subsidies, improving tax administration, and reassessing tax exemptions can provide funding. Reorient agricultural funding towards ecosystem services and climate change outcomes. Promote open agricultural input trade, but manage distributional impacts. A uniform global carbon price could impact food security in developing countries, necessitating careful consideration of border tax adjustments. Improve international cooperation for technology sharing. Small farms are important for dairy/meat production. True-cost accounting is needed to reflect the real cost of food and address economic distortions, considering externalities like GHG emissions and land-use changes.","The reviewed material primarily focuses on food systems, food security, and nutrition, with climate change identified as a key driver impacting these areas alongside socio-economic factors. It utilizes modeling frameworks (MIRAGRODEP linked to GLOBIOM and LIST) to quantify agrifood systems in terms of economic, social, environmental, and risk factors, incorporating macroeconomic linkages, multisectoral interactions, and household heterogeneity. While lacking direct nation-wide macroeconomic or macro-fiscal risk estimates of climate change and cost-benefit analyses of adaptation, it explores potential interventions like reducing food waste/loss, improving livestock productivity, diversifying crop production, and promoting R&D, and acknowledges the need for international cooperation, technology advances, and policy coherence. Key considerations include trade-offs between food security interventions and GHG emissions/land use, the importance of dietary changes, and the relevance of social factors like gender, Indigenous knowledge, and affordability.

Subsamples are based on aridity index (above/below median) and SPEI (≤ 0 vs. > 0). Dry spells are defined using different durations (e.g., 28+ days, hottest 90 days, hottest 120 days, full year).","The study employs a global panel data analysis of daily precipitation and temperature (1979-2016) to assess the impact of dry spells on crop production (FAO CPI growth). The methodology centers on fixed effects regression models with country and year fixed effects, controlling for factors like average temperature, precipitation, country-specific time trends, prevailing climate regimes, droughts, and aridity. The statistical approach isolates country-specific dry spell exposure anomalies and investigates the moderating effect of irrigation. Robustness is tested through alternative specifications, including adjustments for lagged variables, temperature, precipitation, time trends, alternative covariates, alternate outcomes, different definitions of dry spells, and sequential g-estimation, and weighting days temporally by cropped area. Heterogeneous effects are explored using split-sample estimation and interaction terms based on aridity and SPEI. Standard errors are often clustered at the country level, and panel bootstrap techniques are used.","Dry spells, particularly those lasting 4-5 weeks or more (21+ days), negatively impact crop production growth and FAO CPI growth. These impacts are exacerbated by the co-occurrence of heat waves, drought (SPEI ≤ 0), and aridity, and are most pronounced in unirrigated areas and those experiencing annual water deficits. While dry spells generally have a negative impact, this effect can be mitigated by irrigation and, in some instances, heat waves can lessen the damage. The impact is primarily transitory, with some model specifications showing a positive effect from lagged dry spell days. The effects of dry spells appear to be more significant in areas with below-median aridity or when SPEI ≤ 0.","This study examines the impact of climate stressors on agricultural production, measured by the FAO Crop Production Index (CPI), using a panel dataset of 118 countries (excluding Sub-Saharan Africa). It focuses on punctuated events like dry spells and heatwaves, considering multi-stressor interactions and compounding effects of water stress at different timescales. The analysis leverages within-country variation and employs sequential g-estimation to address endogeneity concerns related to drought. Findings suggest that high temperatures and water deficits exacerbate the negative impacts of dry spells on crop production, while irrigation may offer some mitigation.

Drought risk, projected to increase significantly by 2050, is evaluated by combining water shortage probability with welfare effects, generating a drought risk curve to calculate expected annual economic impact. Adaptation investments in sectors like industry and drinking water are considered, with policy actions evaluated based on avoided drought risk versus societal costs, including monetized and non-monetized effects. The analysis reveals that agriculture bears the brunt of drought risk, while shipping is significantly affected by low Rhine flows. The opportune time for adaptation investment is determined by balancing avoided risk and annual costs.

The econometric models include temperature and precipitation variables (seasonally and monthly), industry-region growth lags, and fixed effects (time and region). Data harmonization involves adjusting GDP series with different base years using adjustment factors and deflating nominal GDP using the UF. Weather data from the University of Delaware is aggregated to the regional level using geospatial software. The analysis uses OLS regressions, exploring various coefficient selections (all, statistically significant, and negative/significant only). Simulations project GDP impacts under different temperature increases and climate emission paths (using UN and IPCC SSP scenarios), considering results for 2017, 2050, and 2100. A counterfactual exercise also applies temperature impact coefficients from a US-based model to Chilean industries. Robust standard errors are clustered by year and region.","Chile's historical GDP (1985-2017) has not been significantly impacted by climate change, though precipitation has decreased and temperatures have increased. Certain sectors, particularly Agriculture-Silviculture and Fishing, are negatively affected by rising temperatures, especially during the summer; a 1°C increase in January can reduce Fishing GDP by 12%. Mining is also negatively affected. While some sectors may even benefit from temperature increases, projections show that Agriculture, Fishing, Manufacturing, EGA, Construction, and Commerce face reduced growth rates with rising temperatures. Models project that Fishing GDP could almost disappear by 2100 under certain scenarios, with Mining and Home property also significantly declining. However, total Chilean GDP is projected to increase across all scenarios in 2050 and 2100 when all model coefficients are considered, but this outcome may not be accurate given the potential for positive feedback loops to be limited. Depending on the model and coefficients used, negative impacts on total GDP could range from 9% to 14.8% in 2050 and 16.8% to 29.6% in 2100; other estimates range from 6.8-12.9% deterioration by 2050 and 15.5-42.3% by 2100. The impact varies depending on the coefficients used. Mining represents over 50% of GDP in regions II and III, while financial services and commerce are more prevalent in the capital region of Santiago (Region XIII), which represents 40% of national GDP.","Analyzes the impact of rising temperatures on Chilean economic activities beyond weather-exposed sectors, utilizing National Accounts data from the Central Bank of Chile.

The modeling framework builds upon Tanoue et al. [19] and involves multiple steps: bias-corrected meteorological forcing data, Land Surface Model (MATSIRO), Inundation Model (CaMa-Flood), Land Use and Damage-depth Function, GDP and Asset Modeling, and BI loss modeling. Gridded GDP is calculated based on a linear relationship between building height data and subnational GDP from 11 countries. BI loss is estimated based on gridded GDP, the GDP ratio of secondary and tertiary industries, and the inundation period, assuming proportionality between the inundation period and the BI period. The inundation period and annual maximum inundation depth are calculated from daily water storage using FLOPROS and a high-resolution digital elevation model. Simulations are performed using reanalysis data (1960-2013) and GCM data for historical (1961-2005) and future (RCP8.5, 2006-2098) scenarios, coupled with SSP3 GDP data. Asset damage estimation is validated against previous studies. Future BI loss and asset damage are estimated for near-term (2021-2050) and long-term (2061-2090) periods and compared to past (1971-2000) estimates. The impact of flood protection levels is analyzed by targeting river basins with similar ratios of BI loss to asset damage using reanalysis simulation with and without flood protection (1960-2013).","Projected increases in global flood risk due to climate change show significant increases in both business interruption (BI) loss and asset damage, with BI loss often underestimated compared to asset damage in global assessments. BI loss can be as extensive as asset damage, particularly in Africa and Europe. While America and Europe have high absolute BI loss, their BI loss as a percentage of GDP is lower compared to the global average. Flood protection measures substantially reduce both BI loss and asset damage, with a more pronounced effect on BI loss.

Maximum deviations in BI loss and asset damage estimates across climate models are significant (137.9% and 101.2%, respectively). Flood protection significantly impacts BI loss, potentially more so than direct asset damage, suggesting a mechanism linking floods and economic activity. Malawi's 2012 BI loss varied greatly with and without flood protection. Estimation values may remain first order due to model, dataset and method uncertainties.

Instead, it employs econometric methods such as quantile regression, logistic (LOGIT) regression, and panel data approaches to analyze the impact of observed climate risk on various macroeconomic indicators.","This study employs a panel data approach utilizing quantile and logistic (LOGIT) regressions to analyze the impact of climate risk on stock market capitalization, sovereign risk (proxied by sovereign CDS spreads), and competitiveness. Quantile regression, particularly panel data quantile regression, is used to account for potential heterogeneity between countries and asymmetric distributions in the dependent variables, specifically CDS and market capitalization. LOGIT regression is used to identify the determinants of competitiveness and the influence of climate risk on it. Data sources include Bloomberg, Knoema, The Global Economy, and the Heritage Foundation. The quantile regression analysis of CDS spreads is particularly relevant for countries with high economic and financial complexity and political stability.","Climate risks adversely affect stock market capitalization and sovereign risk, particularly in countries with lower credit default swap (CDS) levels. The impact is more pronounced in countries with mid-range market capitalization and is inversely related to quantile size; lower quantiles exhibit stronger impacts. Sovereign CDS variations are influenced by macroeconomic, governance, and financial factors, with notable quantile-specific variations in economic growth, inflation, control of corruption, political stability, and financial freedom. Quantile regression highlights statistically significant levels of climate risk impact, revealing its considerable influence on markets with economic/financial complexity and political stability. Despite a negative correlation, climate risk's impact on competitiveness and certain macroeconomic variables appears limited. Climate events increase country risk primarily in low budget deficit contexts, with limited influence on countries at low or very high market capitalization levels.","A panel data analysis (2008-2019) of 22 OECD countries (mostly EU members) with 263 observations explores the impact of climate risk on the economy and competitiveness. Using a climate risk index, the study finds that sensitivity of country risk to economic, financial, and political factors is amplified when sovereign CDS spreads are high. Climate risk's impact on market capitalization is insignificant at extreme ends of market capitalization. Unemployment and Corruption have the most positive influence on competitiveness, while political factors have a negative influence (assessed via LOGIT estimation). A key limitation acknowledged is the difficulty in accurately estimating climate change impacts on sovereign risk, particularly in high-risk countries, suggesting further work in developing indicators for climate risk and competitiveness.",Macroeconomic/Fiscal,Econometric,,,Global,,Transitional (accounting for changes over time),,"Adaptation isn't explicitly mentioned in the provided text.

It also uses top-down approaches like multi-region, multi-sector Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models (e.g., GRACE, calibrated using GTAP) for macroeconomic impact assessment. GRACE is used for global consequences of climate change on standardized, economic indicators for evaluation of economic development, including assessing autonomous adaptation (air conditioners, mechanization) under different emission scenarios. CGE models are noted to sometimes use static or recursive-dynamic approaches, limiting representation of anticipatory adaptation.

Other methods include developing climate risk storylines, using impact models translated climate conditions, and using global sensitivity analysis to evaluate model robustness, and time-varying global sensitivity analysis. Systems modelling is used to evaluate adaptation options through simulations. The review discusses Impact and Adaptation Response Surfaces (IRS/ARS), and Ensemble Outcome Agreement (EOA) for evaluating adaptation options.

Specific applications include disaster risk reduction (DRR) modeling, regional flood modeling (RFM), and weather index insurance (WII) modeling. Downscaling of climate model outputs, especially for local-scale analysis, is a common technique. Land System Modular Model (LandSyMM) integrates climate impacts, land management, commodity consumption, land use, vegetation, and climate into a worldwide dynamic economic system.

The materials also highlight the importance of participatory methods, 'top-down meets bottom-up' approaches, including hybrid top-down and bottom-up assessments of infrastructure networks, surveys of (socio-)hydrology and (institutional) economics, and life cycle assessments to identify emission-dense sectors. Furthermore, the role of insurers' underwriting and pricing practices are analyzed using nat cat models with loss estimation and risk-based premiums. Several observational studies are carried out, including the analysis of mortgage delinquency rates and event mortality rates related to storm surge floods across different world regions","Adaptation is critical for diminishing the adverse impacts of climate change, yet faces challenges including gaps in usability for policymakers, complex temporal dimensions, uncertainty, and a lack of standardized metrics. Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) often incorporate adaptation simplistically, potentially underestimating its benefits and using ad-hoc cost assumptions. Different modeling approaches (top-down vs. bottom-up) capture impacts differently, with GRACE offering a flexible framework to depict cross-sectoral and regional interactions and assess mitigation-adaptation trade-offs. Macroeconomic analyses may underestimate vulnerability in sectors like agriculture, while heat stress can lead to GDP decline, partially offset by autonomous adaptation. Storylines, global sensitivity analysis, and local factors are crucial for understanding and managing uncertainty, improving model evaluation and stakeholder confidence. Effective adaptation requires managing uncertainty in agricultural projections, selecting optimal combinations of cultivars and management strategies, and prioritizing coastal management measures. Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) measures, assessed ex-ante, are crucial and can be exposure-reducing or pathway-obstructing. Indirect impacts should be included in assessments, and cost-benefit analyses are advised. Salience, credibility, model capabilities, impact thresholds, and uncertainty representation are key challenges. Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) offer a sustainable approach to risk reduction. Societal change and economic development impact damage increases; integrated flood risk management can positively influence vulnerability. Urban climate services and Weather-Based Index Insurance (WII) can improve services and mitigate agricultural risks, but WII is vulnerable to imperfect weather forecasts. Improved flood hazard modelling is needed. Cascading failures in infrastructure networks and reciprocal feedbacks between human and water systems need consideration via models like LandSyMM, which can also assess trade-offs in mitigation policies and land manager adaptation decisions. Risk and decision analysis are powerful tools for water sector adaptation, promoting flexibility, robustness, and multi-objective optimization. Network analyses can prioritize systemic resilience investments. Robustness, rather than complete probabilistic descriptions, should guide decision-making. Techno-institutional complexes create barriers. The European Green Deal necessitates science-based emissions targets, creating both transition risks and opportunities for the private sector. Insurers can contribute through risk reduction incentives in products, with potential premium reductions from measures like elevating houses. A significant protection gap exists for Business Interruption (BI) risks. Adaptation measures in property and insurance can reduce credit risk and mortgage delinquency rates. The impact chain approach aids risk analysis, communication, and identification of adaptation entry points. JPI Climate aims to provide integrated climate knowledge and decision support.","Literature on adaptation costs is scarce, and local damages are uncertain. Adaptive capacity in IAMs needs harmonization with SSPs. Regional/sectoral aggregation is flexible; farm size and consumption patterns are important factors. Autonomous mechanization is linked to SSPs. There is a need for better integration of proactive adaptation under uncertainties into macroeconomic models. Efficient societal uptake of climate information requires tailoring and user guidance. Focus is often on evaluating climate change impact models rather than direct macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes, necessitating better model validation. Wave setup uncertainty is frequently neglected in coastal hazard assessments. Long-term monitoring is crucial for stress-testing and benchmarking adaptation projects. Case studies, like winter wheat in Spain, may not translate to national macroeconomic outcomes. Maladaptation can result from incomplete analysis. Expert judgment, stakeholder involvement, and vulnerability relationships are key for DRR measures. Data limitations, difficulty in use by end-users, and improved knowledge transfer are prevalent limitations. Sectoral testing is being performed in Finland (e.g., agriculture, water management), but some methods have limited uptake and are subject to ongoing research. Monitoring and empirical data are needed to understand changes in vulnerability and risk, and modeling is necessary for projecting future trends in flood risk. Focus is on urban adaptation, relevant as a subnational component, including the Climate-fit.City project, which does not provide national level data. Crop insurance and index-based schemes can redistribute risk and enhance resilience, but require crop and region-specific adaptations. Improvements are needed in global flood models (GFMs) regarding topography, flow estimation, and river network parameterization. Adaptation mechanisms can be direct or indirect, responding to market or policy changes. Addressing mitigation-adaptation interactions in the land system is important. Water resources and agriculture are common areas of focus, with Spanish case studies prevalent. Open-source Python-based tools are used in some analyses (e.g., Vietnam, Argentina transport). Data collection is key to reduce model uncertainties. Interdisciplinary integration (e.g., socio-hydrology, institutional economics) is weak. Flexible, interdisciplinary modular hierarchies are needed to understand human-water systems. The goal is a harmonized methodology to create a detailed emissions inventory and risk disclosure. Transitional risks affect the private sector, requiring adaptation of business models. Insurance can incentivize proactive management of business interruption risks. Standard BI insurance may be insufficient for widespread natural catastrophes. FEMA designations are used to partition data. A framework has been applied in nearly twenty national climate risk assessments worldwide. Decision-making for climate change adaptation is affected by deep uncertainty. JPI Climate coordinates climate research. Integration among disciplines remains weak and allows only for a fractioned understanding and partial representation of uncertainty. Adaptively efficient institutions in water resource management are studied.",Macroeconomic/Fiscal,,Acute shocks,Adaptive,Global,Sectoral Interactions,Adaptive (reflecting shifts in economic behavior in response to impacts),Other,"Adaptation is incorporated into Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) differently: DICE implicitly, AD-DICE explicitly disaggregates damage, FUND uses cost-benefit analysis for coastal protection and assumes autonomous adaptation in agriculture, and PAGE introduces a tolerable temperature. Geoengineering is considered as adaptation in ICAM, MERGE and IMAGE models. The GRACE model simulates autonomous adaptation such as air conditioning and mechanization, comparing different climate scenarios and levels of mechanization. CGE models are often static or recursive-dynamic, limiting anticipatory adaptation representation. Climate risk storylines are developed to map socio-economic consequences. Systems modelling evaluates adaptation options through simulations with and without adaptations. Impact and Adaptation Response Surfaces (IRS and ARS) are used for qualitative assessments. An Ensemble Outcome Agreement (EOA) index assesses confidence in adaptation outcomes. Models can be used to assess Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) measures in coastal areas and model disaster risk reduction at coastal areas and their effectiveness. Global Sensitivity Analysis is used to determine factors that control the vulnerability of coastal flood defences. Regional Flood Models (RFM) are used for damage calculation. Statistical downscaling is used in cities, as well as other data gathering methods. Models are used to simulate weather index insurance. The Land System Modular Model (LandSyMM) integrates climate impacts, land management, commodity consumption, land use, vegetation, and climate into a dynamic economic system. Water resource system simulation is used to predict the hydrologic, socioeconomic, and environmental consequences of water management. Top-down and bottom-up approaches are combined for water resource management and infrastructure network adaptation. Hybrid methodologies quantify climate vulnerabilities, risks, and adaptation for infrastructure networks. Model hierarchies of human-water systems assess policy performance. Insurers can contribute to adaptation through underwriting and pricing practices, using models to estimate losses and reflect risk-based premiums.",,,,,,,,

These models incorporate climate feedbacks, growth effects (including damage persistence), and interannual temperature variability. Uncertainty is addressed through Monte Carlo simulations (typically 50,000 runs). Several analyses employ regression techniques, including fixed effects regressions with temperature and precipitation lags (up to 5), and country-specific time trends, often based on Burke et al. (2015) data. Low-pass filtering is applied to climate variables in some regressions, and bootstrap resampling is used to estimate standard errors. Some analyses focus on specific country income levels (above or below median GDP per capita). The impact of parameter changes on SCCO2 is also explored through deterministic runs and sensitivity analysis (varying parameters by one standard deviation). Additionally, models incorporating exponential and linear interpolation of various factors, autoregressive temperature projections and population and income extension models were used.","Synopsis: The PAGE-ICE model, extended to explore climate-economy feedbacks and interannual variability, reveals a doubling of the mean Social Cost of Carbon (SCCO2) compared to PAGE09, primarily due to increased costs in the Global South. Empirically derived damage persistence significantly impacts global GDP and its regional distribution, leading to considerable income redistribution detrimental to poorer regions. Even small amounts of damage persistence substantially increase the SCCO2, and high persistence with low adaptation can lead to damage caps and SCCO2 estimates of zero. Annual temperature variability widens SCCO2 uncertainty ranges. Damage persistence is a critical factor in SCCO2 calculation. Including temperature anomalies and annualizing the model framework affect SCCO2 estimates. Tolerable temperature changes before discontinuities significantly impact SCCO2. Sensitivity analysis identifies 'tcr_transientresponse' and 'tdis_tolerabilitydisc' as key parameters influencing SCCO2. Consideration of various SSPs (1-5) is included. Empirical analysis suggests that not all temperature-induced damages persist, and longer temperature lags reduce estimated economic impact persistence. The impact of temperature on GDP per capita growth diminishes with lag and varies across income groups. Damage persistence varies considerably depending on the number of temperature lags included in the model. Adaptation efforts can limit capital stock vulnerability and decay rates of damage persistence affect the SCCO2 estimate. Models including CO2 concentration and LOESS of observed GMST better explain GMST variance than those using just Year as a predictor.","The PAGE-ICE model is used to estimate the Social Cost of Carbon (SCCO2), considering climate feedbacks and economic updates, with minor variations in SCCO2 values possible due to interaction effects of model changes. Regional empirical damage estimates in PAGE-ICE account for potential warming benefits in cooler regions. A total climate damage cap in the model can underestimate the SCCO2 under high damage persistence, and one outlier run was omitted from Monte Carlo means. The SCCO2 increase is largely driven by adverse impacts on the Global South. The model's design and discontinuity sector changes cause differences in annual SCCO2 distributions from earlier versions. Uncertainty within the PAGE-ICE model, particularly parameter uncertainty, significantly impacts the SCCO2; parameters with at least a $2 absolute SCCO2 impact are highlighted. Consumption is bounded and equity weighting limited to mitigate economic collapse and infinite utility issues. Regional heterogeneity of damage persistence exists, alongside varying adaptation barriers. Countries with insufficient temperature/precipitation data periodicity were discarded from analysis, and different minimum periodicities were used for comparison. The share of SCCO2 runs equaling zero decreases slightly after analysis. Temperature data are processed using 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year low-pass filters, and a global model of damage persistence without regional disaggregation was used. Future research should focus on growth effects in the Global South.",Macroeconomic/Fiscal,,Chronic trends,Adaptive,Global,Sequential Interactions,Adaptive (reflecting shifts in economic behavior in response to impacts),Tipping Points,"Adaptation is explored through its effect on reducing damage persistence at a constant annual rate, as shown in PAGE-ICE model simulations.

The models utilize historical weather and agricultural TFP data, often spanning from 1961/62 to 2015, with some analyses focusing on sub-periods like 1989-2015 or 1962-1988. Various model specifications are explored, including different temperature variables (Tmax, Tmean, Tmin), functional forms (quadratic, cubic), regression and aggregation weights, growing season definitions, and heterogeneity assumptions (pooled, by latitude). Bias-corrected spatial disaggregation (BCSD) is used to downscale climate model data. Counterfactual climate scenarios from CMIP6 experiments are used to derive the cumulative impact of anthropogenic climate change (ACC). Robustness is assessed through extensive sensitivity analysis, including exploring numerous model variations (e.g., 296 variations) and using techniques like tenfold cross-validation. Statistical significance and uncertainty are addressed through block bootstrapping (year-by-region and country-level) to generate confidence intervals and placebo checks involving random reshuffling of TFP and weather data by years and by country to test for spurious correlations.

While agricultural total factor productivity (TFP) has more than doubled since 1961, this growth is negatively impacted by warmer temperatures during the green season, making agriculture more sensitive to climatic extremes. Specifically, the research analyzes the relationship between green-season temperature and precipitation and country-level TFP, finding a robust relationship between agricultural TFP growth and weather changes, estimating the effect of weather on agricultural TFP growth, and providing response functions for temperature and precipitation.

Projections are probabilistic, incorporating sea-level rise, beach profile, shoreline trends, meteorological drivers, demographic change, and a modified Bruun rule. Analysis constrains erosion via artificial and topographic barriers. The coastal zone is defined as a 10km buffer. Outputs include median projections and 90% confidence intervals of annual ecosystem service values, analyzed under best-case and worst-case scenarios, and related to regional GDP (using constant 2018 prices). Losses are also analyzed relative to demographic changes and are aggregated by NUTS 3 region.","Synopsis: Climate change threatens coastal ecosystem services, potentially resulting in significant economic losses. Europe's coastal ecosystem services were valued at €494.1 billion in 2018 and are projected to decline by 2.2-2.4% by 2050 and 4.2-5.1% by 2100. Salt marshes face the highest absolute losses, while beaches, sands, and dunes are most vulnerable in relative terms. Losses could reach up to €42 billion annually. Denmark, Albania, Greece, Estonia, and Finland are projected to be most affected relative to GDP, while Germany, the Netherlands, and France face the largest absolute losses. Coastal erosion disproportionately affects certain regions and countries. Population change influences future loss projections, with southern and central Europe facing demographic decline while northern Europe grows. Uncertainty in ecosystem service valuation and coastal erosion projections increases over time. Deforestation caused the largest ecosystem service loss between 2000 and 2018. Coastal ecosystem service contributions are concentrated along coastlines, with variations across Europe.","Focuses on ecosystem service losses from coastal erosion in Europe, analyzing impacts at the NUTS 3 regional level. Emphasizes the urgency of mitigation. Quantifies ecosystem service losses (regulating, habitat, provisioning, cultural), with wetlands projected to suffer the largest relative value declines, and forests and semi-natural areas the largest absolute declines; intensive agriculture is expected to be least affected. Acknowledges data uncertainties, especially concerning subnational demographics, land cover, erosion projections, ecosystem service valuation, and barriers to erosion. Analysis utilizes median projections for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, including 90% confidence intervals. Concentrates on relative losses to identify severely affected areas, noting that actual losses in 2100 could be lower due to GDP growth.

Instead, it analyzes historical data from 1990-2019 in Saudi Arabia related to GDP growth, inflation, unemployment, population, rainfall, temperature, and carbon emissions.","The study employs an Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach to cointegration to investigate the short- and long-run relationships among economic growth, inflation, unemployment, population, rainfall, temperature, and carbon emissions in Saudi Arabia. The analysis utilizes data from 1990-2019 sourced from the Meteorology and Environmental Protection open data source and a Cobb-Douglas production function (GDPG = f(CO2, RF, TEPT, INF, POPL, UNEMP)). The ARDL method is chosen due to the mixed order of integration of the data. Model validation includes unit root tests (ADF, PP, KPSS), diagnostic tests (Breusch-Godfrey, Heteroskedasticity, ARCH, Ramsey RESET, Jarque-Bera), and stability tests (CUSUM, CUSUM of Squares).

Model lag lengths are selected based on AIC and Schwarz Bayesian Criterion.","Highlights: A study of Saudi Arabia finds long-run cointegration between economic growth and factors like unemployment (positive), carbon emissions (negative), rainfall (negative), temperature (positive), inflation (positive), and population (positive). The study suggests Saudi Arabia can increase economic growth while lowering carbon emissions, even without addressing unemployment, by utilizing technology to manage rainfall and temperature. Short-run impacts on GDP growth are significant for unemployment, population, rainfall, and CO2 emissions. Reliance on foreign labor and petroleum resources is identified as unsustainable in the long run, and adaptation to climate variations and a shift to green energy are crucial for long-term economic stability and growth.","Analysis focuses on Saudi Arabia's economic growth and sustainability within the context of climate change and reliance on fossil fuels, examining the effects of environmental and macroeconomic transformations on GDP using time series data (1990-2019) and ARDL modeling. The study assesses factors impacting economic growth to inform Vision 2030, which aims for economic diversification and macroeconomic stability. Findings include a potentially negative impact of rainfall and CO2 emissions on GDP, attributed to infrastructure limitations and dependence on petroleum, while unemployment and average temperature show a positive, albeit potentially unrealistic, correlation with GDP. Robustness of the ARDL model is assessed with various diagnostic tests and stability assessments.

The methodology includes: (1) Panel data regressions using fiscal reaction functions to explain primary balances, with lagged debt and debt squared as independent variables. Robustness is assessed using commodity terms of trade. (2) Examination of public debt dynamics via government cash-flow constraints and nonlinear fiscal reaction functions, visualizing the debt-growth nexus.

The analysis compares various fiscal rules (debt, budget balance, expenditure, revenue, cash buffer) and proposes a fiscal policy framework that incorporates expected shock impacts on fiscal balances.","Pacific Island nations face significant macroeconomic and macro-fiscal risks from natural disasters and climate change, impacting debt sustainability and economic growth. Investment-friendly recurrent expenditure rules, based on stable revenue sources (non-resource, non-grant), are preferable to GDP-based or revenue-capping rules due to revenue volatility, automatic stabilizer effects, and faster data availability. These rules should interdependently determine government debt and budget balance targets, accounting for expected disaster shocks. Managing debt below steady-state levels is crucial, alongside building stabilization funds, cash buffers, and establishing clear escape clauses for disaster events. Fiscal authorities should communicate future fiscal paths clearly when escape clauses are triggered. Commodity exporters benefit from targeting the non-resource primary balance to smooth resource earnings and promote intergenerational equity. Ignoring natural disasters risks procyclicality and unsustainable debt levels. There may be an optimal debt-to-GDP ratio for primary balance.","The fiscal policy framework is designed for developing countries frequently impacted by natural hazards and climate change, focusing particularly on Pacific Island economies. It suggests a recurrent expenditure rule influenced by government debt and budget balance targets, incorporating disaster shocks and volatile commodity prices. Current fiscal literature often overlooks climate and disaster risks; thus, fiscal rules need adaptation, especially in Pacific Islands with insufficient natural disaster funds. Interest payments grow nonlinearly with debt, and the optimal public debt-to-GDP ratio is slightly lower compared to other regions. The framework suggests differentiating between resource and non-resource revenues, emphasizing donor grants for funding. Disaster cost coverage by governments significantly affects economic outcomes. GDP-based fiscal rules are discouraged due to volatility, recommending non-resource, non-grant revenues instead. Challenges include aligning fiscal targets amidst frequent disasters and volatile revenues. Public financial management needs to be enhanced for effective implementation. The framework's applicability extends beyond Pacific Islands, recommending similar approaches for other vulnerable regions like the Caribbean and Indian Ocean countries.",Macroeconomic/Fiscal,Econometric,Acute shocks,Permanent,Regional,,Transitional (accounting for changes over time),,"Adaptation's incorporation into fiscal policy is explored through the lens of natural disaster risk and climate change impacts on debt dynamics, fiscal sustainability, and economic stability, particularly in Pacific Island countries.

Volatility in GDP, revenue, and expenditure and their implications for expenditure rules are examined. The permanent income hypothesis is applied to resource-rich Pacific Island Countries, and stabilization funds and cash buffers are proposed as tools for managing related risks.

The region's high solar irradiation offers a developmental opportunity, particularly for small farmers vulnerable to water scarcity and drought. PV generation can provide a sustainable income source, reduce reliance on government aid, regenerate degraded land, complement hydroelectric power, and strengthen the national energy grid. Initial PV investments can have a payoff time of around 7 years and provide greater economic value compared to traditional rain-fed agriculture. Distributed PV also promotes social inclusion and disaster risk reduction.","Northeast Brazil (NEB) serves as the study region, analyzing PV plants in desertified areas and degraded pastures. The potential of PV to collect rainwater, its impact on water security, and Brazil's interconnected hydroelectric system are considered. The analysis assumes commercially available panels and full hydro potential exploration. PV generation alone yields revenues 2.74 times higher than financial market interest at 6.5%. Realization of this PV potential requires legislative changes, social policies, and recognition of property rights.

A 'delta' method is used to compare ESM simulations. Aggregation occurs from grid-cell level changes to national impacts on final energy demand.

The analysis estimates long-run semi-elasticities of per capita final energy consumption to daily temperature exposure and uses equations to calculate aggregate effects on fuel, sector, and total energy consumption at the country level. Sensitivity analyses are conducted on sectoral and aggregate energy demand responses under different warming scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5), considering temperature and income variations.

Proxy variables for capital stock are used (per capita GDP, aggregate country capital stocks, accumulated real imports of heating/cooling equipment). Panel regression analysis (static, first-difference, dynamic) with fixed effects and robust standard errors are used across regions (Temperate, Tropical, World) and sectors (Residential, Commercial, Industrial, Agriculture), including lagged values. Heterogeneity in demand response across sectors, fuels, and regions is considered.","Climate change is anticipated to increase global energy demand, particularly in low-and middle-income countries, with distinct variations across regions and sectors. South America, Asia, and Africa face heightened demand, while responses in Europe, North America, and Oceania vary. Energy demand is influenced by temperature, humidity, capital, and past consumption, and exhibits a non-linear, V-shaped response with regional and sectoral sensitivities. The effects are disproportionately larger in developing countries, especially in tropical regions, manifesting as regressive impacts at the global level. The energy demand response differs across sectors, fuel types, and climate zones, with cooling needs met by electricity and heating needs divided among various fuels.

Predictive models indicate a prospective increase in energy consumption globally, potentially five-fold by 2050, with electricity gaining a larger share. Emerging economies, particularly in the tropics, could see a ninefold surge, whereas high latitude nations may quadruple their energy demand. Despite these changes, climate-driven impacts remain secondary compared to those from economic growth, although the combined effect is substantial, possibly amplifying demand by up to 19.3% under rapid warming scenarios.

Temperature and humidity have significant, though varied, impacts on real GDP per capita, with distinct effects noted both in the short and long run. These impacts vary by sector and region, potentially influencing electricity demand and GDP growth significantly in certain tropical areas. Notably, there is a geographic and seasonal re-distribution of energy demand towards tropical regions and summer months, driven by changes in socioeconomic and climatic conditions. The study emphasizes the importance of considering sectoral and regional variations, alongside economic expansion, when evaluating macroeconomic and macro-fiscal risks induced by climate change.","The study models the impact of climate change on national-level energy demand, focusing on temperature sensitivity across regions (Temperate/Tropical) and sectors. It projects future energy demand under different warming scenarios (primarily RCP 8.5) using income thresholds to differentiate low, middle, and high-income countries. The analysis is limited by its focus on energy consumption alone, without directly quantifying GDP, productivity, fiscal outcomes, or adaptation costs/benefits. Key limitations include reliance on a single ESM and socioeconomic scenario, the assumption of uniform sub-national energy demand, data limitations (especially energy prices in the tropics), and low R-squared values in GDP regressions. The study finds a regressive impact of climate change on energy demand, with tropical countries experiencing the largest increases, particularly in the industrial and residential sectors. An asymmetric response to temperature changes is observed, with varying impacts across sectors and fuel types depending on region and temperature (hot/cold). The relationship between GDP and energy demand is highly variable. The study highlights the importance of accurately projecting temperature effects on energy demand but notes challenges in aligning empirical and climate model data. Results exhibit a long upper tail of impacts due to uncertainties in energy consumption’s responses to income and meteorology. Specific humidity is used as a temperature measure, despite relative humidity being a better indicator of cooling demand.",Macroeconomic/Fiscal,Econometric,Chronic trends,Adaptive,Regional,Sectoral Interactions,Transitional (accounting for changes over time),,"The paper models energy demand responses to temperature, considering regional and sectoral heterogeneity. An intertemporal optimization model is used to simulate agents adjusting energy demand to achieve thermal performance targets.

The core methodology involves regressing the growth rate of state GDP (GSP) on average seasonal temperatures, controlling for lagged GSP growth, state fixed effects, and year fixed effects. Data spans 1957-2012 in some specifications, with analyses often split into pre- and post-1997 subsamples. Weather data is sourced from NOAA, aggregated from station-level to county and state levels, and deseasonalized using monthly dummies. States are often weighted by their GSP share, and robustness checks include alternative weighting schemes, temperature data sources (e.g., gridded data, population-weighted data), definitions of seasons, and data aggregation methods. Standard errors are typically clustered at the year, state, or both levels. Several extensions and robustness checks are implemented, including the use of Arellano-Bond estimation to address dynamic panel data issues, consideration of spatial correlation, inclusion of precipitation and temperature volatility as controls, and examination of sector-specific impacts. The methodology projects GDP growth impacts by combining estimated impact coefficients with temperature projections from climate models under various emission scenarios. The analysis explores both contemporaneous and lagged (1-year) temperature effects, and uses Wald tests to assess the significance of combined effects.","Rising temperatures, particularly in summer, have pervasive negative effects on U.S. economic growth and labor productivity, impacting various industries such as finance, services, retail, wholesale, construction, and agriculture. Specifically, increased summer temperatures can reduce GDP growth rates significantly, with potential reductions up to 1.2 percentage points under high emission scenarios. This effect is notably pronounced in Southern states and warmer regions, where the negative impacts on productivity and gross state product (GSP) are most severe. The agriculture, forestry, and fishing sector is notably sensitive to temperature variations, exhibiting the largest negative impact. 

Summer temperature increases, particularly in July and August, strongly affect the economic growth rates, with these effects being robust across different temperature data aggregation and deseasonalization methods. Lagged temperatures suggest a statistically significant impact mainly for summer and fall, with some regional variations in the effect on sectors pre- and post-1997. However, the statistical significance of temperature impacts, including fall temperatures, varies depending on the data and methods analyzed. While some sectors, like utilities, may benefit from rising temperatures, overall, the negative effects dominate. Additionally, temperature changes affect health, leading to increased hospitalizations and implications for the insurance sector.

Temperature changes, particularly in summer, do not influence growth rates solely in less developed states, although they show stronger negative effects. There's a high sensitivity in GDP growth to temperature variations, contributing to welfare costs due to GDP growth volatility. Moreover, temperature impacts are elaborated through labor productivity, rather than employment growth, demonstrating notable autocorrelation in GDP growth rates across states.","A U.S. state-level analysis (1957-2012) examines the impact of temperature on economic growth (GSP) and labor productivity, focusing on growth effects rather than level effects. It utilizes seasonal temperatures (degrees Fahrenheit), finding summer temperatures negatively impact growth, especially in Southern states, while fall temperatures may have a weaker, positive effect. The summer effect is more robust, and the analysis considers a permanent 1°F increase. The study uses industry output and employment data, though data availability limitations influence choices like focusing on private sector labor productivity and using seasonal temperatures. Analysis accounts for changes in NAICS codes post-1997, which introduces data discontinuities. The paper assesses the long-term impact on U.S. growth by combining impact coefficients with temperature change projections, while noting that impacts vary by season and region.

Several approaches are highlighted, including Robust Decision Making (RDM), Dynamic Adaptive Planning (DAP), Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPP), Info-Gap Decision Theory (IG), and Engineering Options Analysis (EOA).

RDM combines exploratory modeling, scenario analysis, and vulnerability/tradeoff analyses to identify robust strategies that perform well across a wide range of plausible futures, minimizing regret. Scenario Discovery (SD) is used to identify critical factors influencing strategy success/failure. DAP designs flexible strategies with monitoring systems and triggers for adaptation actions, often utilizing adaptation tipping points (ATPs). DAPP integrates DAP with adaptation pathways, exploring alternative routes for action. IG prioritizes alternatives based on robustness, assessing how wrong a model can be before outcomes become unacceptable, and uses robustness functions. EOA explores combinations of solutions and values flexibility in system design, emphasizing multi-criteria decision-making and managing downside risks and upside opportunities.

Exploratory Modeling (EM) facilitates stress testing and global sensitivity analysis. Various models (agent-based, integrated assessment) are used, often coupled with Monte Carlo simulations and sensitivity analyses. Key concepts include defining objectives, evaluating strategies, identifying vulnerabilities, analyzing tradeoffs, and developing adaptive strategies. Visualization and 'deliberation with analysis' are important. Frameworks like DMDU (Define, Measure, Develop, Deploy) and the OODA loop are also mentioned. Specific case studies use climate stress testing with stochastic weather generators and multi-criteria analysis for evaluating adaptation strategies. Several studies use country-specific climate scenarios (e.g. KNMI). Adaptive Delta Management (ADM) principles are implemented within the Dutch Delta Programme.","Highlights:

Ignoring deep uncertainty leads to poor long-term decisions. Robust Decision Making (RDM) identifies robust policy mixes (carbon taxes and technology subsidies) and adaptive strategies. Combined tax and subsidy strategies are generally more robust than single-instrument approaches, performing best across a wider range of scenarios, although taxes-only can be optimal in specific cases (small coordination failures, small climate change impacts). Dynamic Adaptive Planning (DAP) combines immediate actions with shaping future actions and preserving flexibility, crucial due to uncertainty. Examples include Schiphol Airport's adaptation plans responding to demand and climate scenarios, including potential runway expansion. Adaptation pathways should consider cost, benefits, and co-benefits, with transfer costs, timing of adaptation tipping points (ATP), and discount rates being sensitive factors. Challenges remain in demonstrating the value of DAP to practitioners and policymakers, especially in resource-constrained settings.

Info-Gap Decision Theory offers robustness (greatest horizon of uncertainty under which an alternative meets requirements) and opportuneness (lowest horizon of uncertainty at which a decision enables better-than-anticipated outcomes). Robustness prioritizes immunity to surprise over outcome optimization. High robustness comes from resilience, redundancy, flexibility, adaptiveness, and comprehensiveness. A performance-robustness trade-off exists, particularly when considering innovative versus standard options. Exploratory Outcome Analysis (EOA) supports stakeholder understanding of possible outcomes, their likelihood, and associated benefits/costs, informing strategic choices. EOA highlights the risks of ignoring uncertainty and the benefits of modular/flexible strategies, especially in uncertain demand scenarios. Modular designs offer greater expected gains, lower risks, and reduced initial capital expenditures.

Adaptive strategies don't eliminate regret entirely but offer more balanced outcomes than static ones. RDM can identify robust adaptive policies for international decarbonization, including carbon taxes and technology subsidies. Optimal environmental regulation adapts to changing climate and technological conditions. Barriers to implementation exist due to uncertainty; DAP can help adapt implementation plans. Analyses recognizing uncertainty lead to different optimal designs than deterministic analyses, which often overestimate project value.

Design Stress (DS) accommodates multi-objective analysis and multiple beliefs about future states. Stress tests are powerful, revealing system sensitivity to climate changes and other stressors. Model correlations should be considered in risk assessments. The Delta Programme in the Netherlands exemplifies a large-scale commitment to climate adaptation and flood management, emphasizing monitoring, evaluation, and adaptation. DMDU approaches provide a common vocabulary for policy design under uncertainty, improving policy robustness through techniques like red-teaming and shifting focus from prediction to exploring futures. Flexible adaptive designs (reactive or proactive) generally outperform fixed designs, offering substantial gains in the face of climate uncertainty; the specific choice depends on beliefs about the future and risk tolerance.","The notes describe decision-making under deep uncertainty (DMDU) approaches, particularly Robust Decision Making (RDM), Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPP), Exploratory Options Analysis (EOA), and Info-Gap decision theory. These methods address situations where traditional modeling and probabilistic forecasting are unreliable.

RDM emphasizes stress-testing decisions against many plausible futures using exploratory modeling, scenario analysis, and an 'XLRM' framework (exogenous uncertainties, policy levers, relationships, measures of performance). It aims for robustness and focuses on tradeoffs, employing expected regret as a criterion. An example RDM study examines greenhouse gas reduction strategies, exploring the role of technology incentives and adaptive carbon tax/subsidy rules at the national/provincial level. However, it does not address pre-commitment issues.

DAPP focuses on identifying adaptation tipping points (ATPs) and avoiding lock-in, emphasizing flexibility and monitoring. Pathways and scorecards are used for decision-making. Examples include low-flow management in the Netherlands. The Dutch Delta Programme exemplifies DAPP implementation.

Info-gap decision theory addresses innovation dilemmas, where innovative solutions may have higher potential benefits but also greater uncertainty. Robustness analysis assesses the sensitivity of options to uncertainty. A simplified mechanical system is used as an analogy, but faces a gap in scale and context,

EOA explores a wider range of possibilities than Real Options Analysis (ROA), which is criticized for requiring detailed statistical data and focusing on single options. EOA emphasizes monitoring, learning, and adaptive management, leading to opening decisions instead of prescribing a single plan. EOA provides distributions of outcomes instead of a singular measure of performance. An example focuses on long-term water resources planning for the Colorado River Basin, exploring different investment signposts and triggers linked to stakeholder preferences for cost and reliability. Another example focuses on LNG plant design investment decisions,

Adaptive Delta Management (ADM) is the approach implemented in the Dutch Delta Programme, focusing on flood safety. The programme aims to stabilize adaptation processes through permanent roles, budgets, and legal structures. The monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system assesses measure execution and facilitates multi-level programming, including mechanisms for adjusting goals and strategies.",Adaptation,,,,,,,,,"While the paper focuses on methodologies for decision-making under deep uncertainty related to climate change, particularly using Robust Decision Making (RDM), Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPP), Info-Gap Decision Theory (IG), and Engineering Options Analysis (EOA), it does not explicitly identify a specific sector of the economy that is universally impacted. The examples used involve water resource management, climate technology policy, infrastructure projects, and delta management, suggesting impacts across various sectors like water, energy, infrastructure, and coastal management. However, the emphasis is on the decision-making processes and strategies to handle uncertainty rather than singling out a particular vulnerable sector.","The benefits of adaptation to climate change are quantified using various analytical frameworks and methodologies that address deep uncertainty in decision-making. Key approaches include Robust Decision Making (RDM), Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPP), and Info-Gap Decision Theory. These methods utilize scenario analysis, stress testing, and exploratory modeling to craft strategies that are robust across a wide range of plausible futures. Tools like Engineering Options Analysis (EOA) and Real Options Analysis evaluate the flexibility and overall value of adaptation strategies by considering multiple criteria such as costs, benefits, and co-benefits over time. Benefits are often assessed using cost-benefit analysis, multi-criteria analysis, and simulation models that factor in economic, environmental, and social impacts of adaptation strategies. These approaches facilitate the identification and implementation of adaptive measures that can effectively manage risks and maximize the benefits of adaptation efforts.","Costs of adaptation to climate change are quantified using various decision-making frameworks and analytical tools that address deep uncertainty and assess the robustness of adaptation strategies. Approaches like Robust Decision Making (RDM), Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPP), and Info-Gap Decision Theory (IG) use scenario discovery and stress testing to explore the consequences of assumptions and promote robust, adaptive strategies. These methods employ quantitative models and simulations to evaluate strategies across multiple plausible futures, identify adaptation tipping points, and inform decision-making by assessing trade-offs, vulnerabilities, and the horizon of uncertainty. Engineering Options Analysis (EOA) and other exploratory approaches further support the quantification of costs by analyzing multiple design scenarios, considering uncertainties in system performance and socio-economic impacts, and determining the value of flexibility in adaptation measures.","The analysis relies primarily on ex-ante modeling.

These methods involve framing decisions, evaluating strategies across multiple futures, vulnerability analysis, tradeoff analysis, and developing adaptive strategies. They utilize exploratory modeling, scenario analysis, stress testing, and monitoring systems with triggers for action. The DMDU (Decision Making Under Deep Uncertainty) framework is highlighted, emphasizing shared strategic vision, adaptive strategies, short-term commitments, long-term options, and monitoring. The processes often involve stakeholder engagement and a ""deliberation with analysis"" learning approach.",,"The provided paper understands sufficient adaptation levels through the lens of robustness and adaptability in the face of deep uncertainty. It focuses on strategies that perform well across a wide range of plausible futures, minimizing regret and identifying vulnerabilities. Being well-adapted means having flexible and adaptive plans that can be adjusted based on monitoring and triggers, avoiding adaptation tipping points, and incorporating a range of options to ensure acceptable performance even under unfavorable conditions. It is about avoiding unacceptable outcomes rather than optimizing for a specific predicted future.","Soft options (e.g., informational and institutional interventions) provide benefits by improving decision-making under deep uncertainty, enabling more robust and adaptive strategies. They enhance understanding of vulnerabilities, facilitate monitoring and learning, and allow for flexible adjustments to policies as new information becomes available, ultimately minimizing regret and maximizing long-term effectiveness. These options are particularly useful when facing uncertain climate impacts by supporting adaptive planning, identifying adaptation tipping points, and allowing for exploration of alternative policy pathways."

This effect diminishes or reverses in warmer regions. While some perceive Russia as potentially benefiting from climate change, vulnerability rankings suggest serious challenges. The impact of temperature on expenditures is cumulative and more pronounced in the medium to long term, potentially underestimated by fixed effects models. Temperature is robustly negatively correlated with total expenditures, while precipitation negatively impacts housing expenditures, and industrial growth positively impacts total expenditures.

Two crop simulation models (CSM-CERES-Wheat and LINGRA) are used to simulate crop yields (wheat and timothy grass) based on stochastically generated weather data from four Global Climate Models (GCMs) under the IPCC A1B emission scenario and historical data. These crop yield simulations are then incorporated into Jordmod, a price-endogenous, spatial, comparative-static, and partial equilibrium model of Norwegian agriculture. Jordmod is modified to incorporate stochastic decision-making, modeling farmers as risk-averse agents operating under yield and payment rate uncertainty. The analysis uses scenario analysis with fixed average climate and policy, climate uncertainty, policy uncertainty, and a combination of both. Parameters are varied within specified ranges, and a discrete stochastic scenario method with N=5 runs per scenario is used. The framework adopts a cascade approach, where crop model outputs feed into the economic model, but there is no feedback loop. The model is comparative-static and represents a future point by projecting exogenous parameters to 2030. Statistical significance testing is applied to crop yield simulations. The results are location and crop-specific and apply to the area modeled by Jordmod.","Norwegian agriculture is vulnerable to climate and policy uncertainty. Climate change is projected to increase average cereal yields and farm incomes by 2050, with varying impacts depending on the climate model. However, it also increases income variance. Red meat production declines under uncertainty, while white meat production expands. Agricultural area decreases under unfavorable conditions. Climate and policy uncertainty combined result in the lowest person-years employed in agriculture, and policy uncertainty causes greater volatility in land rents. While both climate and policy uncertainty increase mean agricultural income, climate uncertainty leads to higher volatility. Social welfare remains relatively stable. Farmers could reduce policy uncertainty by shifting to less subsidized, albeit often less profitable, productions.

While its global contribution to water supply remains relatively small (1.6-1.7% in 2055), desalination will be critical for water security in affected regions, though at a higher GDP cost for MENA, particularly under SSP3. Usage is predicted to increase 1.4-2.1 fold (2011-2040) and 6.7-17.3 fold (2041-2070) compared to 2005. The geographic location of desalination plants will also shift depending on the scenario.","Desalinated water is explicitly modeled as a water source, a feature often absent in Global Hydrological Models (GHMs). The Spatial Distribution Model (SDM) excludes non-hyper-arid regions and faces limitations in projecting future distributions of desalination plants, although new technologies may boost production. Model projections require caution, especially in river regions, as the SDM failed to accurately reproduce conditions in some areas in 2005. Oil-producing nations may have lower desalination thresholds due to fossil fuel consumption. GDP per capita significantly influences desalination production, while water use intensity (varying across SSPs) impacts desalination demand.",Adaptation,,,,,,,,,"The agricultural sector, specifically areas reliant on freshwater resources, and the water sector, particularly regarding water supply and infrastructure, are impacted. The need for seawater desalination, driven by climate change and water scarcity, highlights the vulnerability of these sectors.","The study quantifies the benefits of adaptation (specifically seawater desalination) implicitly by estimating the *economic cost* of desalination under different climate and socioeconomic scenarios. By projecting the volume of desalinated water needed and then applying a unit production cost, the study estimates the expenditure required to adapt to water scarcity. This cost implicitly represents the benefit of having access to that water source, as it reflects the investment society is willing to make to secure water resources under climate change. The study uses a Seawater Desalination Model (SDM) which relies on climate data, income levels, and water use, alongside GDP per capita, aridity, and proximity to the seashore.","Adaptation costs, specifically for seawater desalination, are quantified by projecting future desalination production using a model (SDM) that incorporates climate, income levels (GDP per capita), and water use under different socioeconomic scenarios (SSPs). The economic cost of this desalination is then estimated using unit production costs (USD m−3) derived from global plant data, with sensitivity analyses performed on factors like GDP per capita and aridity. Area utilizing seawater desalination (AUSD) cells is used as a metric.","The analysis primarily relies on ex-ante modeling, using a Seawater Desalination Model (SDM) to project future desalination production under different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and various assumptions. While the model is calibrated using some historical data (e.g., unit production costs), the core of the analysis involves projecting future trends.","The paper discusses adaptation planning and decision-making implicitly through modeling future seawater desalination production under different socioeconomic and climate scenarios (SSPs). The model considers factors like GDP per capita, aridity, and proximity to the seashore, highlighting the sensitivity of desalination as an adaptation strategy to these variables.

Exploiting low-frequency climate variations captures both direct and belief effects but can compromise identification. Estimated temperature effects on maize yields are consistent across timescales except for cross-sectional studies, which may be influenced by belief effects or omitted variable bias. Innovations in climate measurement are critical. Aggregate climate responses are smoother in larger and more heterogeneous regions. Distinguishing between net effects and displacement effects (temporal or spatial) is crucial, considering autocorrelation in climatic exposure. Stratification methods measure the net effectiveness of adaptive actions but not the costs of indirectly observed adaptations. While econometric methods are rapidly evolving and replicability is improving, major methodological innovations are needed to address mechanism identification, adaptation cost measurement, general equilibrium effects, price responses, and unprecedented events.","The notes highlight methodological challenges in causally identifying climate change impacts. Key issues include the fundamental problem of unobservable counterfactuals, the assumption of marginal treatment comparability when extrapolating from weather to climate, and the trade-off between capturing belief effects with low-frequency data and maintaining unit homogeneity.

Projections to the 2050 era reveal both increases and decreases in annual and dry season runoff across 126 basins. Consistently drying regions include northern Africa, southern Europe, southern Africa, southwestern United States/Central America, and Indonesia; wetting regions include southeastern South America, northeastern United States, eastern/southern Asia, and northern latitudes. Notably, runoff changes often exhibit stronger agreement than precipitation trends, particularly drying in eastern Australia and northeastern South America. Adaptation costs are estimated at a median of $15 billion/year globally. Agreement across climate models is higher for economic outcomes linked to runoff, suggesting more robust trends in these impacts despite the limitations of relying on single models or ensembles. Specific basins, such as the Zambezi, Volta, and Niger Rivers, demonstrate magnified effects of precipitation changes on economic outcomes.","Climate change impacts on water resource economics are analyzed using model projections for the 2050 era (vs. 1961-90 baseline) and the UNESCO water stress index. Basin water yield, integrating changes in precipitation, runoff, and land surface dynamics, is a key factor, and is systematically drier than precipitation changes alone. Uncertainty in projections is addressed through a range of climate models/scenarios (e.g., 22A1B, 40NCARs), with longitudinal differences across GCMs being a major source of disagreement. Adaptation costs are defined as those required to maintain historical yields in declining basins, with regional agreement on cost direction (e.g., positive costs in MENA and SSA; benefits in SA; costs in LAC).

This is achieved through increasing water storage capacity (reservoirs) to compensate for decreasing yields. The level of adaptation is deemed sufficient when the necessary storage infrastructure is in place to offset the negative impacts of climate change on water availability, thereby preserving historical water yields.

Model coherence on TC genesis response to climate change is lacking, reflecting differing SST response patterns. There's a potential risk of TC development over the Mediterranean Sea. Uncertainty in future climate poses challenges for adaptation, and adaptation measures can have unintended consequences. Increased hurricane intensity amplifies potential losses, particularly indirect losses, highlighting the importance of resilient economies and efficient reconstruction. The most intense hurricanes (Cat 2-5) in the US are projected to increase in annual probability of landfall, particularly Cat 5 hurricanes, placing some regions, like New Orleans, at elevated risk. The nonlinear increase in losses and the significance of indirect costs must be considered in climate change response strategies.","Understanding tropical cyclone activity and its implications is critical, particularly in the Caribbean, Mexico, and the U.S. Reliable historical records of hurricanes form the basis for analyzing the social and economic importance in these regions. Cyclones' intensity can be linked to solar activity, SSTs, and windshear, with predictions often hindered by model limitations. Regional shifts in landfall probabilities suggest potential changes in economic impacts, requiring consideration of indirect alongside direct losses. Adaptation strategies can mitigate these losses, although their quantitative effects are challenging to determine. Urbanization and economic resilience are significant, influencing recovery post-disaster. The insurance sector is impacted by cyclone predictions, affecting premiums and capital requirements. Uncertainties in climate models and economic predictions highlight the need for comprehensive multi-model analyses to assess risk management and adaptation strategies effectively. The paper suggests the importance of 'no-regret' adaptations in the face of uncertain long-term climate impacts.",Adaptation,,,,,,,,,"The insurance industry is specifically mentioned (page 107) as being an intended audience for hurricane prediction models. The analysis also frequently addresses direct economic losses from hurricanes, with specific focus on coastal regions and infrastructure (pages 368, 369, 371, 374, 375, 376, 377, 378, 381), indicating that sectors related to coastal real estate, tourism, and construction/infrastructure are significantly impacted. Finally, several analyses focus on the impact of hurricanes on Louisiana and housing service production after Hurricane Katrina (pages 384, 385, 386).","Benefits of adaptation are quantified through various economic analyses that assess direct and indirect losses from climate impacts like hurricanes. For direct losses, physical models use datasets on exposure and vulnerability to predict damage ratios, while statistical models create relationships between past hurricane data and economic losses. Indirect losses are evaluated using models like the Adaptive Regional Input-Output (ARIO) model, which accounts for production capacity changes and dynamic behavior post-disaster. Cost-benefit analyses assess infrastructure investments by comparing potential reductions in direct and indirect losses. Additionally, methodological roadmaps integrate these models to assess climate change economic impacts, including adaptation strategies.","Costs of adaptation are quantified through a combination of models and methodologies that evaluate both direct and indirect economic impacts of climate events like hurricanes. On the direct costs side, physical models use datasets to predict losses based on exposure, vulnerability, and hurricane characteristics, while statistical models analyze relationships between past hurricane data and economic impacts. Indirect costs are assessed using models like the Adaptive Regional Input-Output model, which estimates economic disruptions and adaptive responses following a disaster. These analyses also incorporate cost-benefit assessments to gauge infrastructure resilience, and employ downscaling techniques to link global climate changes with local impacts, aiding in the projection of future adaptation costs and strategies.","The analysis relies on both ex-ante modeling and ex-post observations. There's extensive use of statistical models and climate model simulations (ex-ante), often calibrated and validated against historical data (ex-post). The analysis also uses historical observations to establish baseline probabilities and relationships.","The extracted notes focus on modeling and predicting hurricane activity and associated economic impacts, including direct and indirect losses. Specifically in regards to adaptation planning/decision-making, the notes discuss (1) translating changes in hurricane risk into changes in direct losses and indirect economic impacts, (2) assessing the desirability of new infrastructure using cost-benefit analyses, and (3) using models to simulate the economic impact of hurricanes and assess losses in production and reconstruction needs. Further, the notes mention considering adaptation strategies in the assessment of climate change economic impacts.

These temperature shocks reduce current output, savings, investment, and can have lasting consequences on economic growth. High variability in TFP growth rates is linked to fluctuations in temperature and precipitation, with adverse effects concentrated in regions with low income. The growth effects of climate shocks are dynamic, compounding over time and leading to permanent output reductions particularly in poor areas. While the impacts are typically negative in warmer climates, a positive effect of hot weather can be observed in cooler countries. The negative effects of temperature on TFP growth are moderated by economic development, institutional quality, and GDP per capita, diminishing as countries become wealthier. Overall, climate change presents significant macroeconomic and fiscal risks particularly for impoverished nations, making them more vulnerable to recurring temperature shocks due to their reliance on agriculture and the existing development gaps.","The study explores the macroeconomic impacts of climate change on total factor productivity (TFP) growth in developing countries, emphasizing the complementary roles of climate policy and poverty alleviation. It demonstrates that temperature changes negatively affect TFP, particularly in countries with low GDP per capita (defined as below the median GDP in 1960) and high temperatures (defined as above the median temperature in the 1960s). The interaction reveals non-linear impacts, with labor productivity identified as a critical channel, predominantly in poorer regions. The study addresses potential biases from omitted variables by including precipitation data, though these findings are sensitive to model specifications. Correlations between temperature and TFP may be confounded by factors such as institutions, although attempts are made to evaluate the institutional impact. Once countries reach a per capita income threshold of $34,400, negative TFP impacts from temperature seem to dissipate.

Projections primarily focus on temperature increases, often up to 2035, and the analysis accounts for uncertainties related to specification, climate models, and emission scenarios. Robustness checks include dynamic panel specifications, Driscoll-Kraay standard errors, and controls for monetary policy and macroeconomic factors.","Highlights: Rising temperatures drive persistent, nonlinear increases in both food and headline inflation, with stronger effects in hotter months and regions. This impact is consistent across income levels and inflation volatility. Projected global warming will exert considerable upward pressure on inflation in the coming decades, regardless of emission trajectories. Future warming will amplify heat extremes, exacerbating inflationary pressures, particularly on food prices in regions like Southern Europe. By 2060, heat-related inflation in Europe could increase significantly under pessimistic emission scenarios. Climate change is expected to alter inflation seasonality, increase volatility and heterogeneity, and place persistent pressure on inflation levels. Adaptation measures like space cooling and crop switching can limit inflationary pressures, but without substantial mitigation, these pressures will remain significant. The impact on food inflation is robust across different datasets, while headline inflation results vary depending on data construction. Accounting for linear time trends enhances the estimated effects.","Climate change impacts, particularly on inflation, vary regionally and seasonally, with pressures greatest at low latitudes and during summer at high latitudes. Inflationary impacts are amplified in the global south and depend on baseline climate conditions.

(2) Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models, estimated through Bayesian techniques using Metropolis-Hastings algorithms and Dynare, incorporate a weather-dependent agricultural sector and time-varying land productivity influenced by agricultural spending. These models connect the macroeconomy with weather data, using soil moisture deficits and temperature/rainfall as productivity factors. Model comparison is performed using Laplace-approximated marginal data densities. Simulations, using Monte Carlo methods and impulse response functions, are conducted under historical weather conditions and IPCC climate change scenarios (RCPs) with altered weather shock variances derived from CCSM climate data and rolling AR(1) models. The models are solved to a first-order approximation, focusing on farmer optimization and sectoral shares. Variance decomposition and forecast error variance decomposition are used to quantify the impact of weather shocks relative to other shocks. CGE model is also used. Calibration is performed using quarterly data, with some variables detrended. The analysis also considers a model with exogenous weather process and a Cobb-Douglas agricultural sector.","New Zealand's GDP and agricultural output are significantly impacted by weather shocks, with climate change exacerbating negative welfare effects by increasing the variability of macroeconomic variables and inducing costly business cycles. Adverse weather shocks cause agricultural production to contract, leading to declines in consumption and investment, and an increase in hours worked, along with current account deficits and currency depreciation. Droughts lead to persistent effects on land productivity, labor markets, and the overall economy, mimicking a negative total factor productivity shock. A drought shock initially affects agricultural production, declining substantially. The share of the agricultural/primary sector in total output declines while the tertiary sector expands. The shape of the land maintenance cost function is critical in determining the response of agricultural production to a drought shock. Foreign consumption shocks drive export demand and exchange rate dynamics. Time-preference shocks drive capital flows. Weather shocks significantly reduce land productivity and act as negative supply shocks, leading to trade deficits and real exchange rate depreciation. The agricultural sector's effect outweighs other sectors. Climate change, especially under pessimistic scenarios like RCP 8.5, increases the volatility of macroeconomic variables, leading to substantial welfare costs due to weather hysteresis (persistent land productivity deterioration). These costs are non-linear, increasing sharply with the variance of weather shocks. The land expenditure cost and labor substitutability parameters significantly affect the propagation of weather shocks. The paper uses a DSGE model to quantify these impacts and analyzes impulse response functions and variance decomposition to assess the role of weather shocks in driving business cycles and macroeconomic fluctuations.","Synopsis: A Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model, calibrated to New Zealand as a small open economy, is used to analyze the macroeconomic impacts of weather shocks, particularly droughts, on the agricultural sector. Weather is treated as an exogenous process, though the paper justifies this assumption by questioning the feedback loop between human activity and CO2 emissions in standard models. The model incorporates agricultural and non-agricultural sectors, imperfect labor substitutability between them, and endogenous land productivity with associated costs. Foreign economy impacts are simplified. Focus is placed on the effects of weather-related productivity shocks on land productivity, assessing damage function parameters while accounting for limitations in existing Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs).

Weather shocks lead to persistently low GDP and contractionary economic activity, particularly affecting non-financial firms. The Aggregate Climate Index (ACI) reveals that climate risk depresses GDP, CPI, and credit over time, with larger impacts when economic expectations and credit confidence are low. The credit supply diminishes and default risk rises post-shock, with non-state-owned, younger, and smaller firms facing more significant reductions in credit access. Extreme weather exacerbates financial constraints and increases interest rate expenses, especially in the presence of tight monetary policy and financial stress. ACI demonstrates negative relationships with bank loan ratios, value-added, and firm-level output, amplified by low fixed assets and exacerbated during high-risk periods. The need for monetary policy interventions sensitive to these shocks is highlighted, as passive approaches intensify GDP drops. The study underscores the importance of understanding climate risks and adapting monetary policies to mitigate long-term economic impacts.","This study examines the impact of extreme weather events, measured by an Aggregate Climate Index (ACI), on the Chinese economy, particularly at the firm level, using data from 2006 Q1 to 2020 Q4 (and some analysis from 1990-2020).

While farmers' adaptability and land-use substitutions can partially mitigate negative effects, significant losses are anticipated in the forestry and agriculture sectors, particularly for fruit production (especially table grapes). Rainfed wheat cultivation will decline overall, shifting southward. Avocado production is projected to increase. Severe climate change scenarios lead to net income decreases, while moderate scenarios may result in slight increases. Aggregate farm labor demand is expected to decrease under all scenarios. Welfare considerations and resilience are crucial, requiring targeted investments to support communities adapting to new agroclimatic opportunities. Overall impacts on Chilean agriculture are projected to be relatively small due to farmers' flexibility.","This study analyzes climate change impacts on Chile's agricultural sector, focusing on land use and employment shifts under different climate scenarios (A240, A270, B240, B270) and time horizons (2040, 2070). Using locally scaled simulations, the analysis considers both direct yield impacts and farmer responses to profitability changes, predicting, for example, avocado cultivation expansion. However, the study is limited by several assumptions: constant agricultural and forestry land at the municipal level, unchanged real prices of tradable goods, ceteris paribus assumption in land-use projections, and setting aside potential changes to government policy and other factors that might influence land allocations and rural labor demand. It doesn't provide macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes (e.g., GDP effects) and doesn't account for dynamic adaptation, changes in international prices, technologies, or trade agreements. Results are in 2007 USD and primarily reflect regional/subnational changes, not community/household level effects. Farm system investment inertia is considered. The inclusion of table grapes as a line item in national accounts suggests that changes in agricultural production are considered relevant macroeconomic indicators in Chile. Future research should incorporate political-economic models of land policy changes.",Adaptation,,,,,,,,,"Agriculture and forestry are specifically impacted, with a focus on land use, crop yields, and farmer behavior in Chile.","The benefits of adaptation are quantified by modeling changes in land use and agricultural net income under different climate change scenarios, considering farmers' ability to adapt and adjust land allocation based on expected profitability of various agricultural activities.

While it validates models using historical data (e.g., the 2012 drought), the core of the analysis is forward-looking.","The paper discusses adaptation planning/decision-making by comparing ""no adaptation"" scenarios with ""adaptation"" scenarios in the context of future soybean yields under different climate conditions. Adaptation strategies considered include adapting sowing dates, migrating planted regions, and genetic modification of soybean cultivars. The analysis uses models to simulate the effects of adaptation on crop yields and to assess the risks associated with crop failures under different adaptation scenarios.",,"The paper understands sufficient adaptation as a state where future soybean yields, under changed climate conditions, are comparable to yields achieved under current climate baselines. Adaptation strategies explored include adjusting sowing dates, migrating planted regions, and genetic modification, with the goal of minimizing the frequency and impact of extreme events like the 2012 drought on soybean production.

By integrating agro-ecologic and economic models, the analysis assesses climate change impacts on agricultural GDP and prices. AEZ and DSSAT crop models are used with the BLS economic model to forecast the number of people at risk of hunger under various SRES scenarios, both with and without climate change and CO2 fertilization effects, calibrated to the baseline figure of 824 million undernourished individuals in 2000. The approach combines the AEZ model with BLS and various GCM models, based on non-probability IPCC SRES scenarios, emphasizing food availability and access, but with restricted capability to quantify food safety and stability impacts.

Adaptive regional input-output models and investment decision making under deep uncertainty are also employed.","Highlights: Early integrated assessment models combined adaptation costs and residual climate change damages. Economy-wide climate change impacts deserve greater attention due to interconnectedness, with indirect risks potentially exceeding direct effects in some sectors. Uncertainty around adaptation is higher than mitigation, particularly at local levels. Low-income countries face significant adaptation challenges due to limited institutional, financial, and technological capacity. Adaptation timing is crucial, depending on the net present value of early versus late action. The effect of economic development on vulnerability is ambiguous and depends on the type of development. Understanding adaptation strategies for extreme climate change scenarios (3-4°C warming) is crucial, including the ability to transition between adaptation regimes. Finally, there is a global ranking of port cities with high exposure to climate extremes.","Early climate models often assumed optimal adaptation, focusing on emissions reduction. Newer models attempt to optimize adaptation and mitigation separately. General equilibrium models, while useful for long-term analysis, don't capture short-term shocks. Adaptation practitioners are incorporating climate risks into development planning, but policy evaluation and understanding adaptation to extreme climate events remain priorities, despite limited empirical evidence.",Adaptation,,,,,,,,,"Yes, the paper mentions sector-level policy evaluation for adaptation effectiveness.","Benefits of adaptation are quantified through various methods including integrated assessment models, system-wide models (CGE, macroeconomic models, input/output analysis), sector-level policy evaluation, and net present value (NPV) calculations that compare costs and discounted early and later benefits of adaptation investments. Decision-making tools also consider adaptation under uncertainty.","Adaptation costs are quantified using a variety of methods as highlighted in the notes. Integrated assessment models (IAMs) are utilized for long-term global simulations of economic and biophysical processes associated with climate change. System-wide models like Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models analyze the economy-wide and combined effects of adaptation strategies. Decision-making tools are discussed for adaptation under uncertainty, which is crucial in scenarios where probabilities of climate outcomes are indeterminate. The Net Present Value (NPV) method is used to evaluate the timing of adaptation investments, comparing costs and benefits at different times and discounting them to present value. Adaptive regional input-output models are also employed for investment decision-making under deep uncertainty.

However, it implicitly suggests that sufficient adaptation can be understood through:

1.  **Cost-benefit analysis:** Determining the optimal timing and investment levels of adaptation by comparing the net present value (NPV) of early versus later adaptation actions. This suggests adaptation is ""sufficient"" when the NPV is maximized.
2.  **Economy-wide effects:** System-wide models (CGE, macroeconomic models, and I/O analysis) are used to analyze the combined effect of adaptation to multiple climate risks. Therefore, ""sufficient adaptation"" would be achieved when economy-wide vulnerabilities are minimized, or overall economic well-being is maximized, through adaptation strategies.
3.  **Sector-level policy effectiveness:** Evaluating the effectiveness of adaptation policies at the sector level. ""Sufficient adaptation"" would entail the implementation of effective adaptation policies across all sectors.

A novel empirical framework captures nonlinear debt dynamics and asymmetric responses to various determinants. The analysis distinguishes between emerging and low-income economies and advanced economies, using data from 68 countries. Missing data is imputed using a Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm, and the model incorporates a time-varying market factor derived from yield spreads using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Factor-augmented panel quantile regression and linear quantile mixed models (LQMM) with random effects are considered to address unobserved heterogeneity. Idiosyncratic components are modeled as a mixture of distributions. Statistical significance is assessed using a block-bootstrap procedure. Variables are scaled to zero mean and unit variance. Some models incorporate common factors using PCA. Bayesian approaches and Mixed Hidden Markov Quantile Regression Models are also explored. EMDAT disaster indicators are utilized, and the analysis controls for country-idiosyncratic effects, and fiscal rules and crises.","Sovereign risk exhibits asymmetric responses to its drivers, with climate change vulnerability significantly impacting shorter debt maturities, particularly for high-risk countries. Investing in climate change preparedness mitigates sovereign risk, especially for countries with low spreads and long-term debt; however, it may be insufficient for high-risk, short-term debt nations. Vulnerability and readiness to climate change are more influential than the occurrence of natural disasters in determining spreads. Higher debt-to-GDP ratio, inflation, and climate change vulnerability increase sovereign spreads, while improved institutions and preparedness lower them. Inflation's impact is more pronounced when sovereign risk is already high. Climate change poses an asymmetric risk to emerging and low-income countries. While natural disasters can increase sovereign risk across maturities, their direct effect is often insignificant once traditional risk determinants are accounted for. Economic complexity is a predictor of lower borrowing costs.

Economic losses from natural disasters increase spreads, with the study incorporating three disaster variables to capture heterogeneous impacts. The methodology addresses missing data in sovereign yield data using random forests and incorporates information on all available maturities.

Adaptation could reduce impacts from $4 trillion to $990 billion. The economic impacts on US agriculture are modest, but issues like carbon fertilization and water availability require more analysis. GHG mitigation can greatly reduce negative impacts, and infrastructure adaptation offers significant capacity improvements. Rising temperatures will increase electricity demand and expenditures, while labor productivity may eventually increase. Recreational benefits, like those in Hawaii, show the positive potential under mitigation scenarios, but wildfire and energy challenges loom. Quality of economic estimates is improving, yet extreme events need more focus. Climate change could directly cost 0.8-3.5% of GDP, with wider macroeconomic effects captured in models like RHG-MUSE reducing costs.","The material stems from analyses motivated by projects like U.S. EPA's CIRA, IPCC AR5, the U.S. National Climate Assessment, and the Risky Business Project, highlighting the limited availability of economic cost estimates and the importance of adaptation. Sectoral economic impact analyses should ideally provide estimates with and without cost-effective adaptation. CIRA incorporates adaptation at farm and market levels, while Risky Business includes carbon fertilization. Several models are used, yielding a range of potential economic impacts. A table displays monetary quantification of risks and adaptation benefits across sectors (interpretation challenging due to formatting). Figures like $990 billion and $4 trillion are based on CIRA. Coastal property value at risk is quantified, but impacts net of adaptation, social vulnerability, and ecosystem effects are underaddressed. Water resources are important intersectorally, with limited econometric models except in CIRA's flooding analysis. Infrastructure analyses need more realistic learning, baseline maintenance, secondary damage considerations, and better handling of extreme events, potentially through econometric approaches linking climate to construction costs. The electricity demand analysis focuses on power system costs, not GDP effects or broader fiscal impacts. Quantified economic benefits in recreation are a subset of total benefits. The analysis emphasizes direct effects on economic assets, largely ignoring indirect effects like business interruption and long-term capital losses. Intersectoral effects, such as the water-energy nexus, are crucial but often omitted; integrating water availability as a constraint on irrigated agriculture and cooling water on power production is suggested.",Macroeconomic/Fiscal,Econometric,Chronic trends,Adaptive,,Sectoral Interactions,Adaptive (reflecting shifts in economic behavior in response to impacts),,"Adaptation strategies are assessed using benefit-cost frameworks, incorporating climate change impact studies and site-specific scenarios.

It combines Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) for temperature trajectories with Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) for economic growth, inequality, and population change. The analysis incorporates a damage function, including findings related to climate tipping points, and the DICE model damage function, adjusting SSP scenarios based on literature. The model simulates production using Cobb-Douglas production functions and updates poverty rates based on consumption and Gini index projections. Different SSP-RCP scenarios are compared to illustrate potential outcomes.","Climate change is projected to reduce global GDP (ranging from -0.2 to -0.6% by 2030, -0.8 to -1.5% by 2050, and -0.8 to -3.2% by 2070), potentially leading to cumulative economic losses of trillions of dollars. Inequality will likely increase, exacerbating poverty, particularly through agricultural impacts. Under specific scenarios (e.g., SSP3-RCP 6.0, SSP2-RCP 4.5), climate change could push millions more into poverty (e.g., 30 million by 2030, 78 million by 2050, and 130 million by 2070 in SSP3-RCP 6.0; an additional 40 million by 2050 in SSP2-RCP 4.5). By 2070, a significant percentage (nearly 40% in an IFs-RCP 6.0 scenario) of those in extreme poverty could be attributable to climate change. Surpassing climate tipping points by 2100 could result in a 25% global GDP loss. Improving income distribution is crucial to mitigating these long-term impacts; for example, a 15% reduction in income inequality could offset increased poverty under an extreme climate scenario. Models using macro-level relationships may underestimate the true impact of climate change on poverty by neglecting micro-level dynamics, with forecasts of climate-driven poverty increases potentially lower than bottom-up estimates.","The study uses the IFs model to analyze the impact of climate change on poverty, considering socioeconomic development pathways and incorporating climate tipping points.

The difference in economic outcomes between adaptation strategies and a 'no adaptation' scenario provides a measure of the benefits of adaptation.","The costs of adaptation in this study are quantified by simulating different adaptation strategies in agricultural systems under various climate scenarios and assessing their impact on crop yields and economic outcomes. This involves comparing the economic returns of farmers employing 'no adaptation,' 'perfect adaptation,' and 'intermediate adaptation' strategies, using crop models, genetic algorithms to optimize land allocation, and considering factors like weather patterns, soil type, and crop genetics.

The analysis predominantly focuses on dynamic modeling, simulations, and social protection schemes without referring to standardized scenarios such as SSPs (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways) or RCPs (Representative Concentration Pathways).","A dynamic, multi-generational household model, loosely calibrated on pastoral regions of East Africa, is used to analyze the impact of climate-related shocks and social protection schemes on consumption, accumulation, risk management, and long-term poverty. The model of 'dynasties' examines the allocation of scarce resources and the evolution of human capital across four generations. Numerical dynamic programming is used to simulate alternative social protection schemes, including cash transfers, vulnerability-targeted social protection (VSP) prioritizing those hit by shocks, and insurance models, with a focus on their impact on poverty dynamics and asset levels given a fixed government social protection budget. The model explores how initial endowments affect long-term poverty status and incorporates contingent transfers to address the poverty gap.","Vulnerability-targeted contingent social protection (VSP) can improve long-term poverty levels and depth compared to conventional cash transfers, particularly by stabilizing poverty after shocks. Targeting fixed social protection budgets towards the vulnerable reduces both the extent and depth of poverty over time. However, there are short-term trade-offs, as pure cash transfers may initially benefit the destitute more. The vulnerable face limits to self-financing due to price elasticity and liquidity constraints, creating a feedback loop between consumption, nutrition, and human capital that can lead to long-term destitution. Multiple equilibria and a 'Micawber threshold' for asset levels exist, leading to poverty traps. Shocks can have irreversible consequences, trapping households in chronic poverty, exacerbated by nutritional penalties and human capital deterioration. VSP, contingent on asset losses and lower consumption, aims to close the poverty gap and is particularly effective at mitigating long-term poverty. Higher risk environments increase destitution and vulnerability. Partial subsidy schemes for VSP show promise by relaxing trade-offs within social protection systems.","The material focuses on the macroeconomic and fiscal aspects of vulnerability-targeted social protection (VSP) in the context of climate change, particularly its impact on poverty dynamics.

A ""clean adaptation"" strategy, balancing renewables, energy efficiency, and hydropower, offers potential economic benefits, emissions reductions, and lower fuel costs, but requires significant institutional and market changes, including investments in renewable energy technologies to offset low capacity factors. Climate-proofing NDCs and exceeding mitigation targets is feasible and potentially economically beneficial, but requires aggressive action to avoid losing NDC gains at high economic and environmental costs. Harmonization between hydropower planning, water/agriculture policy, and the development of a balancing market for intermittent renewables is crucial. Energy efficiency and demand-side management are increasingly important. A revised System Development Plan (SDP+) accounts for project delays. Analysis suggests integrating analysis in the electricity sector allows for cost harmonization and captures co-benefits of off-grid electrification and reduced emissions.","The Zimbabwean energy sector is vulnerable to climate change due to its carbon intensity and reliance on rainfall-dependent hydropower. While clean adaptation strategies involving less hydropower and coal are explored, the analysis focuses on the power sector and lacks direct macroeconomic/fiscal outcomes or detailed cost/benefit analyses. Short-term power shortages can persist despite adaptation efforts, and restructuring costs associated with clean adaptation are not fully accounted for. Regional power trade is highlighted as a critical adaptation measure, requiring structural changes, market adjustments, and local adaptation. Strong commitment, political will, and policy coherence are essential for successful implementation. The study utilizes official national data, but acknowledges limitations and the need for updates.

The 1974 RPA legislation amended by the 1990 Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act, which includes climate change, is relevant. Scenarios generally span from 1990/91 to 2065 or 2100.","Climate change presents mixed impacts on the forest sector, highlighting both adaptability and vulnerability. While forest productivity, particularly net primary productivity (NPP), is projected to increase in the USA, the benefits vary regionally, with southern regions experiencing less productivity gain compared to northern and high-elevation areas. Enhanced forest management practices can boost productivity beyond natural climate effects, illustrating a capacity for adaptive management. Although both regeneration and dieback are possible, climate change is expected to increase timber growth overall, leading to lower log prices, higher consumption, and improved economic welfare on a global scale. However, these benefits are accompanied by regional disparities; regions like North America and the former Soviet Union may face welfare losses despite global gains. The market impact is mitigated by trade, which can stabilize regional markets and dampen adverse effects. Therefore, while consumers globally might benefit, regional timber-producing areas could be disadvantaged within the evolving climate change landscape.","The potential impacts and adaptive responses to forest mortality due to climate change include measures like salvage harvesting and planting of appropriate species. Climate change projections estimate an increase in net primary productivity (NPP) by 8-27%, with different scenarios considering changes in carbon dioxide levels and the corresponding impact on timber types and supply regions. Analysis from 1993 to 2005 links NPP and vegetation biomass changes with regional timber assessments, highlighting that increased timber inventories may not lead to increased harvests if market dynamics and climate change are considered. The South sees the greatest inventory increases under climate-and-carbon-dioxide scenarios, while hardwood inventories decline without climate impact. Management options focus on short-term timber supply without considering salvage, genetic stock changes, or species migration. The study separately analyzes climate impact on timber owners, processors, and consumers, noting regions with lower fiber production costs can expand harvests. Uncertainties in economic models, seen as significant as in climate models, underscore the importance of both economic and biophysical responses. Modeling limitations related to species migration and forest succession constrain management recommendations. The importance of economic adjustments, trade considerations, and developments like those in the former Soviet Union remains critical to understanding timber market dynamics.",Adaptation,,,,,,,,,"Yes, the forest sector is specifically impacted.","Benefits of adaptation are quantified by assessing the changes in net present value (NPV) of timber market surplus, welfare changes to timber producers, log processors, and product consumers, and changes in forest productivity and yield. This often involves using forest sector models, climate models, biogeochemical models, and economic scenarios to project impacts on timber markets, regional forest activity, and vegetation dynamics. Discount rates are used to calculate NPV, and different emission scenarios are considered to account for uncertainty.","Costs of adaptation, within the context of the forest sector as described in this paper, are quantified using a combination of climate models (GCMs), biogeochemical models (TEM, CENTURY, BIOME-BGC), and forest sector market models (ATLAS, CGTM, FASOM) with intertemporal optimization. These models are used to project changes in net primary productivity (NPP), timber yields, and vegetation biomass under various climate scenarios. The projected changes are then used to estimate the impact on timber supply, demand, prices, and ultimately, economic welfare (e.g., changes in net present value of timber market surplus) across different regions and forest types. Discount rates (e.g., 4% or 5%) are used to calculate net present value. Scenarios (high, moderate, and low emission) are also used to address uncertainty.","The analysis primarily relies on ex-ante modeling. It uses climate models (GCMs), biogeochemical models (TEM, etc.), and forest sector models to project future impacts of climate change on forests, timber markets, and related economic variables. While there might be some consideration of past trends to calibrate the models, the core of the analysis involves simulating future scenarios and assessing their potential consequences.","Climate change adaptation planning and decision-making processes involve using various analytical models to assess the impacts of climate change on forests and timber markets. Key elements include the use of climate models to project future ecosystem productivity, adjustments in timber yield based on projected climate scenarios, and the adoption of forest sector market models with intertemporal optimization to evaluate market dynamics. The studies explore the effects of different climate scenarios on forest resources and employ methods like downscaling to regional levels to manage uncertainty. This process also incorporates assessing both intensive and extensive margins of change, addressing welfare impacts across producers and consumers, and applying projections to guide adaptive strategies in the forestry sector.",,"This paper focuses on the impacts of climate change on forest productivity and the timber market. It does not directly define ""sufficient adaptation levels.""

Key methods include the entropy weighting method to construct the GAD index and the difference-in-differences (DID) approach to evaluate causal effects and address endogeneity concerns. The DID model incorporates county-level and time fixed effects, leveraging rainfall fluctuations as a continuous variable to gauge the snow disaster's severity, with data spanning from 2000 to 2018 across thousands of counties. Additional methodologies include Propensity Score Matching with DID (PSM-DID) and two-stage least squares (2SLS) models with instrumental variables for robustness.

Temperature increases and precipitation patterns significantly influence agricultural growth, particularly in poor countries where poverty and extreme heat exacerbate these effects. Temperature shocks negatively impact the short-run growth of poor countries, potentially affecting economic levels, while possibly yielding positive level effects in richer nations. High temperatures reduce economic growth rates in poor countries in the short run, and temperature shocks primarily affect levels of economic output rather than sustained growth rates. Econometric considerations point to the equivalence of certain high-frequency estimators with fixed-effects nonlinear least squares estimators.","The paper explores econometric methods applicable to panel data analysis with mixed sampling frequencies (MIDAS), which can be utilized for macroeconomic analyses in the context of climate change. It examines parameters identification, model performance under different conditions, and evaluates hypothesis testing methods regarding parameter weights. The study finds implications for agricultural growth models, where the effects of precipitation on growth are statistically insignificant, and assesses temperature impacts with significance noted across various model specifications and control variables.

Heckman selection models are used to address sample selection bias related to agricultural households. The regressions include fixed effects for year and location (Thana) and often cluster standard errors at the district level. The analysis considers birth cohorts from 1964-1980 and excludes specific regions. Parallel trends are assessed using regression analysis. Several empirical specifications are used, including interactions with rural location, parental schooling, and other variables. Data is sourced from the EM-DAT database.

Severe cyclone exposure had significant negative impacts on these outcomes for cohorts born between 1969 and 1971 in the Barisal and Noakhali regions. Rural households face greater adversity due to infrastructure deficits, with government investments in education and infrastructure potentially mitigating the long-term harms. While parental education doesn't always show a significant mitigating effect, schooling in general can play a remedial role.

It employs an area fixed-effects regression model to estimate the causal impact of ambient air temperature on claims, controlling for variables such as day of the week and precipitation. Poisson regression analysis is primarily used, incorporating Month-Year-Postcode fixed-effects and clustering standard errors at the postcode level. The methodology focuses on semi-elasticity, quantifying the percentage change in claims per 1°C increase in temperature, and evaluates the period 2000-2020, particularly for high-risk occupations like laborers and tradespersons. A two-stage approach separates firm-level effects, identifying high- and low-claim firms. The analysis also estimates the economic impact of claims using Safe Work Australia's cost data and examines the temperature's effect on claims within sectors such as Construction, Manufacturing, and Agriculture, Forestry & Fishing. The cost impacts were estimated through temperature bins and claims over the 35-year period.","High temperatures are strongly linked to increased occupational health claims, especially among manual workers such as laborers and tradespersons in outdoor industries like agriculture and construction. The relationship between temperature increases and workplace injury claims has intensified over time, with same-day and preceding day temperatures both having statistically significant effects. Heat-related injuries typically involve concentration and psychomotor performance deficits, leading to accidents such as burns and collisions with objects. The impact varies by industry, occupation, age, and firm size, with higher income workers experiencing more pronounced effects. Firm-level risk management practices can mitigate heat-related risks, as reflected in lower percentage increases in claims in some firms. Overall, manual workers in high-risk occupations remain significantly vulnerable to heat, despite policy interventions.","The study analyzes the impact of heat on worker's compensation claims in Victoria, Australia, presenting results as the percentage change in claims per 1°C increase. The analysis considers occupation, worker, and workplace characteristics, including firm size, and controls for air pollution and calendar effects. Results reflect residual risk after adaptation. Effects vary by industry, with 'Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing' being more negatively impacted. Large firms exhibit lower heat sensitivity, potentially due to heat policies.

Entrants from high-income brackets can initially mitigate this decline, but without new entrants, property values face immediate reduction. Reducing subsidies for beach nourishment results in increased volatility, sharp declines in oceanfront property values, and narrower beaches, ultimately raising the median owner income tax rate and diminishing investor property ownership.

Some analyses also consider overall standardized rainfall being below its mean.","The study utilizes a comprehensive methodology to assess the macroeconomic and macro-fiscal impacts of climate change at the national level in India, focusing on the effects of monsoon rainfall variations from 1967 to 2005.

Empirical analysis is conducted using NSS data, accounting for rainfall asymmetry in migration and food trading determinants. A Panel VAR model with third-order lags and district-level/state-year fixed effects captures persistent monsoon effects across 310 districts. Rainfall data is standardized by gridded monthly metrics, decomposing shocks into regional (64% variance) and local (36% variance) contributions.

The methodology employs scatterplots with binned data, LOWESS and linear spline regression to display the relationship between monsoon rainfall and agricultural yield, controlling for irrigation interactions. Univariate regressions with district-clustered standard errors assess the impact of rainfall shocks, and a quasi-event study analyzes severe shocks with a 3-year window.

Impulse response functions within the VAR framework explore yield, wage, and price responses, adjusting confidence intervals for data limitations. Subsample regressions analyze district size and irrigation levels, with regional shocks based on NSS regions. Effects on laborers and cultivators are considered through partial equilibrium methods and endogenous consumption responses, using NSS data from 1989-2006.

The approach includes distinguishing between positive/negative rainfall shocks and their spatial aspects, capturing lasting market effects.","Monsoon rainfall shocks in India, particularly droughts, have asymmetric and long-lasting negative effects on agricultural yield, wages, and food prices. Droughts cause larger yield losses than excessive rainfall gains, leading to persistent wage declines and food price increases for up to five years. The impact is most pronounced at low levels of irrigation, and regional droughts have a greater impact on yields than local droughts. While intra-regional arbitrage trading can mitigate food price increases from local shocks, supra-regional trade networks are incomplete. Negative rainfall shocks disproportionately harm agricultural laborers due to wage stagnation and increased food prices, leading to consumption expenditure reductions on staple foods, with laborers experiencing prolonged impacts compared to cultivators. State-level relief programs may not effectively target the most vulnerable districts with low irrigation. Positive rainfall shocks have limited or even initially negative impacts on agricultural yield, but can benefit Rabi crop yields in the subsequent year. Timing of rainfall is also important with sensitivity in crop yields changing throughout the growing season.","This study analyzes the macroeconomic impacts of rainfall shocks in India, focusing on the Kharif season and its effects on agricultural yields, wages, and food prices. It finds a non-linear relationship between rainfall and yield, moderated by irrigation. Negative rainfall shocks have disproportionately larger impacts than positive shocks, especially on agricultural wages, which experience near-permanent effects. Migration and arbitrage trading offer limited mitigation. The study suggests that a significant portion of agricultural laborers are credit-constrained and vulnerable to income fluctuations. Irrigation can buffer wage declines after drought but not food price increases. Government support should be long-term due to lasting real income effects. The analysis considers limitations related to food expenditure shares, land ownership, and road connectivity.",Macroeconomic/Fiscal,Econometric,Acute shocks,Adaptive,Local,Spatial Interactions,Transitional (accounting for changes over time),N/A,"In the provided paper, adaptation is primarily examined through the lens of regional and local rainfall shocks and their impacts on agricultural yield, labor wages, and food prices across Indian districts.

It employs the coupled ADCIRC+SWAN model to simulate storm surge and wave inundation, both currently and under future sea-level rise scenarios (2050), for specific storm events. SLAMM (Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model) is used to project land cover changes, particularly transformations in coastal wetlands and marshes, due to SLR. A 'damages avoided' method compares flood damages with and without the presence of natural habitats, utilizing parcel-level property data and depth-damage functions. The methodology incorporates land use and land cover information from the C-CAP database to represent wetlands and their dissipation effects in the hydrodynamic model. The spatially explicit analysis is applied to three coastal counties in New Jersey, adjacent to the Jacques Cousteau National Estuarine Research Reserve (JCNERR). Additional approaches mentioned for broader analysis include the DIVA Wetland Change Model, choice experiments, and field-based numerical modelling of wave propagation across marshes.","Coastal wetlands and marshes provide significant flood protection services, reducing flood depth and property damage, particularly during less intense storm events. Their protective value is estimated at millions of dollars, with per-square-kilometer values ranging from $53,000 to $138,000. While sea level rise (SLR) is expected to decrease marsh availability, the proportional impact of natural habitats on flood depth reduction may increase under future SLR conditions, although the number of properties protected may decrease. The avoided damage is highest under the 50-year storm event and Hurricane Sandy, and valuations are considered conservative estimates. These habitats offer coastal resilience and flood protection by reducing storm surge and wave impacts.","This study models storm surge and wave impacts, focusing on the JCNERR (New Jersey) and surrounding areas, to assess the role of natural habitats in coastal resilience under SLR. It uses the SLAMM model and considers input from protected area managers, acknowledging uncertainties in SLR projections and landscape response. The analysis estimates flood depth, property damage, and the protective value of natural habitats, finding that one square kilometer can reduce residential damage by $34,000-$53,000 currently and $7,000-$138,000 under SLR for selected storms. While protective services value varied across storms, the study emphasizes primary data collection in coastal wetlands for improved quantification and recognizes its JCNERR-specific findings and focus on residential structures as limitations, suggesting conservative estimates of ecosystem service values.
