The analysis tracks disaster costs, net domestic product (NDP), and consumption of fixed capital (CFC) from 1980-2023, calculating ratios to assess economic impact. It addresses the System of National Accounts (SNA) treatment of disaster costs, comparing current methods to the pre-2008 US BEA approach, suggesting including a trend of expected disaster costs in CFC instead of full disaster costs (currently recorded in 'other changes in the volume of assets account'). It also uses a trend as an estimate and the CPI to create a real series.
","Economic impact estimates vary significantly across modeling approaches as global temperatures rise. Extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and predictable. Disaster costs, while a relatively small portion of NDP, are increasing over time, exhibiting significant volatility. Using a trend-based approach rather than full disaster costs may provide a smoother and better proxy for expected costs. Catastrophic losses are associated with large-scale events destroying significant assets.","Accounting for weather/climate disaster damage as regular capital consumption is proposed. The analysis uses empirical data from NOAA NCEI (2024) and assumes unbiased expectations. The focus is on identifying events causing significant asset losses for inclusion in national accounts, but the text does not quantitatively estimate macroeconomic or fiscal impacts, analyze adaptation, or provide extensive methodological details. Future research directions are briefly mentioned.

The model integrates capital, labor, clean and dirty energy to produce output, with region-specific emissions and damages assessed through pattern scaling techniques to ascertain regional temperatures. It calibrates damage functions using the Krusell and Smith (2022) and DICE 2016 models, incorporating updates from Folini et al. (2024), to study various policies like Universal Welfare Increase (UWI), focusing on regions' capacities for individual climate change mitigation.

Two approaches are utilized: dynamic economic modeling with CES production functions and general equilibrium models, exploring competitive equilibriums and finite energy reserves. The analysis evaluates the economic impacts of carbon policies while modeling regional GDPs, Total Factor Productivity (TFP), and emissions scenarios. Models simulate impacts of varying carbon tax policies and transfer schemes across different damage function specifications under Business As Usual (BAU) scenarios, comparing these to IPCC RCP scenarios. 

The study uses computed general equilibrium models and dynamic fiscal policy frameworks extending projections to 2250, iterating through numerical solutions to optimize global carbon tax rates. Other elements include simulating economic transformations with gradual clean energy transitions, using data from sources like the World Bank and EIA, while analyzing regional commodity consumption impacts. Regional SCC calculations assess emissions' damages, benefiting policy formation at national and global levels.","Synopsis: Climate change will differentially undermine regional economic growth, with India particularly vulnerable. While labor productivity growth remains a dominant economic driver, climate damages can be significantly mitigated by global carbon taxation, particularly through a uniform welfare improving (UWI) carbon tax coupled with redistribution. However, even optimal carbon tax policies can only limit peak global damages by a limited amount. China's participation in carbon policy is critical. The speed of transitioning to clean energy has limited impact on the optimal taxation path, though it affects short/medium-term dirty energy use. Regional total factor productivity peaks at an optimal temperature, with deviations causing losses. Absent policy, some regions (Russia, Canada) may initially gain from warming. Optimal initial carbon taxes are sensitive to the damage function, and the UWI policy involves significant intergenerational transfers. While carbon taxation can dramatically reduce regional damage, the social cost of carbon (SCC) varies regionally, with China and the US being the most significant. Carbon taxation needs to be global to be effective, and delaying action reduces UWI gains. The redistributive aspect of UWI might be politically challenging due to the high taxes on future cohorts and vulnerable regions; UWI with limits (UWIL) can improve welfare in some cases. Regional SCC can be lower than global, limiting the benefits of partial participation.","This research employs a regionalized integrated assessment model (IAM) with feedback loops between temperature, damages, production, and emissions to analyze the macroeconomic and macro-fiscal impacts of climate change and carbon taxation policies. The model features region-specific temperature and damage functions, technologies, and resource extraction costs, including non-negative dirty energy consumption and increasing extraction costs as reserves decline. It incorporates clean and dirty energy, capital mobility via a world interest rate, and three carbon reservoirs. The analysis focuses on the production side of the economy and considers a millennium time horizon for stabilization, using a certainty-equivalent approach. Different carbon policy scenarios are simulated, including uniform carbon tax with various transfer schemes (UWI, UWIF, UWIL) to address distributional concerns across regions and generations, and the potential for sovereign debt defaults. Key findings relate to the impact of climate change damage levels on outcomes, the influence of transfer schemes on welfare distribution, the effectiveness of carbon taxation in achieving emission reductions near Paris Agreement targets, and potential time consistency problems with future taxes, alongside issues of fairness. The model is calibrated using energy consumption data and incorporates assumptions from DICE and other studies, comparing its damage predictions with DICE (2017). Scenarios are run to 2217. The study considers the 'Green Paradox' and acknowledges the importance of gradual transition and technological improvement, such as carbon capture, and incorporates the possibility that some regions might initially benefit from climate change. The analysis uses country groupings such as ANZ, BRA, CND, CHI, EEU, GBR, IND, JSHK, MENA, MEX, RUS, SAF, SAP, SLA, SOV, SSA, US, and WEU, projecting that China and India will account for a significant portion of global GDP by 2100.

DEMACRO-ESS extends the standard DEMACRO model to incorporate water and land as natural capital, utilizing multi-level production functions with CES and Armington elasticities and allowing for labor market imperfections. The model features (neo) Keynesian characteristics, simulates monthly frequency, and incorporates different investment behavior specifications (perfect foresight, myopic expectations, and imperfect foresight). Scenarios of temporal water scarcity are incorporated by reducing the water efficiency parameter, and sensitivity analysis is conducted by varying Armington trade elasticity. The model is used to analyze the macroeconomic and sectoral effects of water scarcity.","Highlights: Water scarcity negatively impacts GDP, investment, employment, and water use, with the severity and recovery time dependent on the shock's intensity and timing, and firms' investment behavior (foresightful vs. myopic). Proactive measures and investment foresight significantly mitigate negative economic effects. Water-dependent sectors like agriculture, food, and electricity are negatively impacted, while some sectors may benefit from competitiveness effects, potentially increasing water use. Open economies can experience a positive GDP effect but negative employment impact during water scarcity. The agriculture, forestry, & fishing sector consistently suffers the most significant negative impacts on GDP, employment, and water use.","A model analyzing water scarcity impacts in Germany explores investment foresight scenarios (myopic, imperfect, perfect) and their effect on economic trajectories. It incorporates green and blue water, land types, and labor mobility, but assumes fixed labor force size. Business-as-usual conditions are assumed for Germany's trade partners. Competitiveness effects and changes in consumer spending partly mitigate negative impacts in some sectors, especially electrical and vehicle manufacturing, but significant impacts are observed in the food and beverage industries due to their dependence on agriculture.

The methodology combines econometric analysis, including truncated Poisson models, OLS regressions, and two-stage least squares (2SLS), with fixed effects (household, week, year-season), to estimate the impact of temperature on labor supply. Regression models control for various factors (age, marital status, education, health, income, precipitation) and differentiate by sector exposure level (high/low) and gender. Empirical findings are used to calibrate damage functions within the OLG model, projecting future scenarios under RCPs and SSP2. A Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model with CES production and utility functions is incorporated, along with stochastic modeling and linear production functions to model gender substitution and sectoral skill intensities. The model simulates climate change impacts on labor productivity and sectoral adjustments, considering non-linear temperature effects differentiated by skill and gender.","Climate change negatively impacts labour supply, particularly for women, due to temperature deviations from optimal levels. While climate change may reduce gender and skill-based wage gaps, especially in high-exposure sectors and among low-skilled workers, these gains are likely offset by overall economic losses due to reduced labour availability and productivity. Maximum temperatures significantly affect labour supply, while average temperatures are a better indicator of damages to labour demand. Adaptation policies should target leveraging potential reductions in the gender pay gap, especially in rural communities. Climate change affects both labour supply and demand, leading to complex impacts on wage inequality and sectoral reallocation.","The study evaluates the macroeconomic and macro-fiscal risks of climate change, specifically relating to gender impacts on labor markets in South Africa, with additional insights from Uganda. Climate change is treated akin to external shocks (e.g., war) but highlights differences in male versus female labor impact. It models climate change effects on labor supply without accounting for shifts in unemployment or wage equilibrium, using scenarios RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 and productivity estimates by Desmet & Rossi-Hansberg. Regression analyses segregate data into high and low exposure groups by gender, also distinguishing impacts on different sectors using South African data. Indirect effects on labor and wage dynamics under general equilibrium conditions are considered, factoring in RCPs and SSPs. The analysis emphasizes the gender pay gap, sector-specific labor divisions, and does not assess future gender wage equalization policies.

It uses a three-way fixed effects panel model with annual national shares of population exposed to TCs to estimate national GDP per capita growth responses (1981-2015), incorporating country and time fixed effects, country-specific time trends, temperature effects (quadratic), and lagged TC wind exposure. Scenario analysis and bootstrapping (1200 bootstraps per country) are used to project TC damages from 2010-2100, fully propagating six uncertainty dimensions (UD1-UD6). The approach translates affected populations into GDP deviations using an empirical growth model, and warming into economic damages using temperature damage functions. The social cost of carbon (SCC) is calculated following Ricke et al.

The methodology builds on integrated assessment models, growth econometrics, and Damage as a percentage of income (DAD) analysis.","Tropical cyclones (TCs) significantly increase the global social cost of carbon (SCC), particularly for major greenhouse gas emitters like India, USA, China, Taiwan, and Japan, suggesting current climate policy benefits are underestimated. TCs induce growth losses in the short-, mid-, and long-term, with heterogeneous impacts across countries, leading to substantial discounted annual damage (DAD). Growth losses increase with global mean temperature (GMT), affecting even high-income countries, implying insufficient adaptation. The relationship between GMT and TC-induced growth is RCP-dependent. Low- and middle-income countries face greater adaptation challenges. Temperature and TC impacts affect GDP per capita growth; omitting either does not significantly change the estimated coefficients of the other.  The TC-induced SCC (TC-SCC) is the difference between the SCC with and without TCs, and discount rates significantly affect SCC estimates.","The research investigates the macroeconomic impacts of climate change, particularly tropical cyclones (TCs), focusing on developing evidence-based National Adaptation Plans (NAPs).

The study addresses RFs' challenges, such as overfitting, using techniques like log-first difference, and employs spatial statistics, econometric estimates, and machine learning methods for comprehensive analysis.","Highlights: Temperature's impact on GDP growth is significant but varies regionally and depends on modeling techniques. Random Forests (RFs) demonstrate superior performance in modeling this relationship compared to traditional regression models (cubic and spline) regarding R-squared, RMSE, MAE, and AIC, exhibiting stable performance and better prediction within the training data. However, RFs tend to underestimate climate impacts and have limited extrapolation abilities, predicting averages of observed values rather than projecting beyond the training data's scope. Temperature increases can significantly impact national GDP, with estimates ranging from a 0.78% decrease in China to a 7% decrease globally with a 1°C warming, although some areas, like northern China, may experience benefits. Accounting for lagged effects of temperature and precipitation is also critical. For every 1°C temperature rise (up to 6.5°C), national GDP change is predicted to be 1% using random forests.","This study uses subnational Chinese data to assess climate change impacts on economic outcomes, employing machine learning methods like Random Forests (RFs) alongside traditional regression (linear spline, quadratic).

It typically uses 10,000 scenarios based on Resources for the Future - Socioeconomic Projections (RFF-SP) for emissions, GDP, and population, sometimes also drawing from Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). A simple climate model, FaIR, calculates global mean surface temperature from US emission trajectories, which, along with population and GDP, are inputs to FrEDI. FrEDI calculates sectoral damages as functions of CONUS warming relative to a 1986-2005 baseline, with CONUS temperature change estimated as 1.42 * global temperature change. Sea level rise impacts use a semi-empirical approach. Analysis can be national and regional. The analysis assesses the net present damage in the US resulting from an additional tonne of CO2, CH4, or N2O emissions.

Damages are projected until 2300 (or sometimes 2090/2100), often involving linear extrapolation of temperature-binned damage functions. The difference between baseline and perturbed (GHG emission pulse) cases yields marginal annual damages, discounted to the emission year to calculate net present damage, using constant (3%) or Ramsey discounting. Differential climate-driven damages across US populations are calculated at the census tract level. Sectoral impacts are considered independent and additive. Climate parameter uncertainty is addressed via Monte Carlo simulation with the FaIR model. Some sector-specific damage functions and scalars are applied, for example, scaling impacts with population, GDP, and per capita income. Sector-specific methodologies are used and adjustment factors are applied.","Climate change is projected to significantly increase net national damages in the US over time, primarily driven by premature mortality due to temperature changes. These damages vary geographically, with the Southeast experiencing the highest per capita impacts, while the Northern Plains experience the lowest. Black or African Americans are disproportionately affected by increased mortality and labor losses. Adaptation, particularly in sectors like coastal property, rail, and roads, can significantly reduce damages, though some sectors already incorporate existing adaptation. The FrEDI model is used to monetize a broad range of climate-driven impacts across various warming scenarios, highlighting the benefits of greenhouse gas mitigation. Estimated total damages in 2090 could reach trillions of dollars annually, with temperature-related mortality alone potentially costing USD 2.3 trillion per year (mean).","Synopsis: This study, focusing on the contiguous US, analyzes climate change impacts through 2300 using the FrEDI model and RFF-SP socioeconomic projections.

The ARDL model, suitable for variables integrated at different orders, is used to test for cointegration (long-run relationships) using the F-statistic or Wald test, while an Error Correction Model (ECM) captures short-run dynamics. The PMG estimation, based on the ARDL structure and a Cobb-Douglas production function, allows for heterogeneous short-run coefficients and homogeneous long-run coefficients across provinces. Lag lengths are determined using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Schwarz information criterion (SIC). The ARDL bounds testing approach follows Pesaran et al. (2001).","Highlights from the study reveal that extreme weather events negatively impact Thailand's agricultural economy, while increased total rainfall positively influences it. Mean average and minimum temperatures reduce agricultural growth variability in the long run. The agricultural economy also benefits from more agricultural households and improved access to water resources, but rainfall intensity and temperature extremes have adverse effects. The study uses an ARDL-ECM framework to examine these relationships, finding that key variables like total rainfall and temperature show stationarity in first differences and exhibit long-run cointegration with economic variables.","A study focusing on the agricultural sector in Thailand examines the impact of climate change (temperature and rainfall) on value-added, considering both climatic and non-climatic factors (technology and labor) in an econometric model. Results highlight the potential for agricultural revenue increases and reduced variability through improved productivity and water resource management, but findings may not be generalizable beyond Thailand's specific agricultural and climatic context.

Methodologically, it utilizes Panel Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) models with country-specific fixed effects and a half-panel Jackknife Fixed Effects (HPJ-FE) estimator. Climate norms are calculated using moving averages over 20, 30, and 40 years. The analysis explores dynamics, feedback, level and growth effects, asymmetric weather effects, and differential climate impacts across climates. A half-panel Jackknife Mean Group (HPJ-MG) estimator is used for heterogeneity analysis. Counterfactual simulations project future GDP growth under different climate scenarios (RCP 2.6, RCP 8.5) by comparing output trajectories with and without temperature changes, and PPP-weighted averages of GDP per capita losses are compared for 2030, 2050, and 2100 under RCP 2.6 and 8.5. Econometric approaches based on dynamic panels and cointegration analysis are employed.","Highlights: Persistent temperature increases and deviations from historical norms negatively impact long-run per capita GDP growth globally, though the magnitude varies by country and climate. Adhering to Paris Agreement goals significantly reduces potential losses. While adaptation can reduce negative economic effects, it is unlikely to fully offset them. Some studies show poor and temperate/hot countries are disproportionately affected, while others find no significant differential impacts across income levels or climates. Climate volatility exacerbates GDP per capita losses. Projections under RCP 8.5 indicate substantial GDP per capita losses by 2100 for major economies like the US and India. Precipitation deviations are generally not statistically significant.","The material critiques the use of trended temperature data in growth regressions due to potential spurious trends and emphasizes the need to model deviations from historical norms, with attention to bi-directional feedback effects between economic growth and climate change. Important references include Tol (2009, 2014), Burke et al. (2015), the IMF (2017), and World Bank data. The study employs ARDL growth regressions avoiding non-existent trends in the data and finds little asymmetry in the long-run relationship between output growth and temperature deviations. While the focus is on temperature changes, similar analyses could extend to precipitation, highlighting the impact of climate change based on temperature magnitude.

The analysis uses temperature data and historical evidence to link temperature changes to mortality, migration, trade, city size (population), and agricultural land use (pasture, cropland, yield ratios, and wheat prices). Regression models employ fixed effects (city, time, decade, parish, county/year, port, country, location), control variables (geographic, historical, access to ocean, Atlantic trade, market access, terrain ruggedness, soil suitability, distance to Roman road, altitude), and adjustments for spatial and serial correlation (Conley standard errors, two-way clustered standard errors, bootstrapped standard errors clustered at the city level, standard errors clustered at the grid level). A gravity model of trade is used to measure potential trade opportunities, and binned scatterplots are used for visualization. The study leverages historical data sources such as Slicher van Bath (1963), Luterbacher et al. (2004), and the History Database of the Global Environment. The empirical approach considers both short-term (year-to-year) and long-term effects of temperature fluctuations and explores adaptation strategies.","Climate change, exemplified by the Little Ice Age, significantly impacts economies, primarily through agricultural productivity, mortality, and city size. Decreased temperatures correlate with reduced agricultural yields, increased mortality (especially in agriculture-dependent economies with limited trade), and smaller city sizes. However, trade acts as a crucial buffer, mitigating these negative effects. Cities with greater trade access and less rugged terrain are less vulnerable to temperature decreases. Adaptation strategies include increased trade, land-use changes (potentially expanding pasture and cropland), and market access. Temperature positively correlates with pasture and cropland area, but the exact relationship between temperature change and land use is complex. Access to trade is key for adapting to the negative economic impacts of long-term temperature changes.","The study examines the historical impact of climate change, particularly during the Little Ice Age in Europe, utilizing historical data from 1500-1850 to assess adaptation strategies such as trade and land use changes. Inland trade opportunities and geographic factors like natural barriers played significant roles in moderating economic impacts of temperature changes. Adaptation challenges in agriculture and energy efficiency are noted, with higher income reducing climate impacts. Historical measures to improve resilience included expanding productive land and trade networks. The analysis extends to the effects of temperature on city size, economic activity, and agricultural productivity, using controls for historical determinants like trade and human capital.

Specific attention is given to ensuring data quality and validity through unit root tests for stationarity and techniques assessing multicollinearity, such as the correlation matrix and Variance Influence Factor (VIF). The analysis leverages a variety of models including the APT model for cost of equity, CAPM with rare disasters, and LOGIT models to identify determinants of competitiveness influenced by climate risk.

Empirical investigations are supported by a broad data spectrum, involving e-journals, working papers, online resources, and survey data. The methodologies used vary significantly across studies and are tailored to the nature of the data and the specific economic contexts addressed, such as countries' levels of sovereign risk, market capitalization, economic complexity, and political stability. Limitations in data sets, especially in high sovereign risk countries, are noted.","Climate risks negatively impact stock market capitalization, particularly in countries with medium capitalization. Climate risks increase sovereign risk when CDS levels are low. Impacts on global competitiveness are negative but generally statistically insignificant. Climate shocks could substantially impact macroeconomic variables and public finances, including the cost of equity, potentially leading to significant global GDP losses. Climate change also increases the cost of public debt. Banks are crucial for transitioning high-polluting countries to low carbon economies. These findings highlight the need for involvement from policymakers, investors, financial regulators, and all economic decision-makers to mitigate financial and macroeconomic risks. The Climate Risk Index (CRI) is statistically sound for use in analysis. Climate change impacts banking stability, financial stability, firm performance, and macroeconomic stability.","This study analyzes the impact of climate risk, particularly in relation to the European Green Pact and a standardized global carbon price, on macroeconomic and financial variables including sovereign risk, stock market capitalization, GDP per capita, inflation, unemployment, corruption perceptions, political stability, and financial freedom. It explores at what levels of market capitalization or sovereign risk climate risk becomes statistically significant, acknowledging limitations due to data availability. The relationship's significance varies across quantiles, with market capitalization impacts being insignificant for countries with very low or very high capitalization. The research aims to develop a competitiveness indicator related to climate risk and relies on references focused on financial market impacts (sovereign bonds, bank loans, stock markets), sovereign risk, firm-level responses, and broader financial system implications.

Notable technical scenario names include: Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), Euro-CORDEX RCMs, GRACE model scenarios, Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) scenarios under historical and climate change conditions, LandSyMM scenarios, and scenarios downscaled from General Circulation Models (GCMs). Additionally, it employs Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) like DICE, FUND, and PAGE for adaptation analysis which likely employ Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs).","Adaptation modeling addresses complex temporal dimensions, risk, and uncertainty, often requiring extended decision support methods and cost-benefit analyses. Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) like DICE, FUND, and PAGE are employed, with evolution towards incorporating climate catastrophes and modularized, open-source approaches. Methodologies include top-down (multi-region, multi-sector CGE models like GRACE assessing economic development impacts) and bottom-up approaches focusing on local impacts. GRACE model modifications address forest management and autonomous adaptation (e.g., air conditioners, mechanization). Combining top-down and bottom-up approaches is advocated. GTAP database version 10 is used in some analyses. Impact models translate climate conditions into variables of interest, evaluated through global sensitivity analysis (GSA) for robustness and parameter control. Stress-testing, field experiments, and systems modelling benchmark adaptation performance using scenarios, monitoring, evaluation, and learning. Participatory frameworks facilitate shared understanding of vulnerabilities and adaptation goals. Agricultural climate projections involve observed climate data with RCM simulations. Disaster risk reduction measures are modelled at coastal areas, differentiating between exposure-reducing and pathway-obstructing measures and combining with cost-benefit analyses. Impact Response Surfaces (IRSs) evaluate climate change risks and adaptation strategies. Model-based risk assessments are updated with new scenarios. Paired event case studies and temporal trend analyses are used alongside stylized models (SYMs), system-of-systems models (SSMs), and agent-based models (ABMs). Climate services provide urban climate data and information, using downscaled climate information and UrbClim model for heat stress and rainfall downscaling. Weather-based insurance schemes (WII) are implemented and theoretically modeled using simulations, including consideration of forecast qualities and non-stationary random processes. Hydroeconomic models, environmentally extended input-output models and Life Cycle Assessments are used. Land System Modular Model (LandSyMM) dynamically models interactions within land systems and explores climate adaptation via different scenarios. Water management models integrate top-down climate projections and bottom-up adaptation measures, optimizing adaptation strategies. Data-driven models assess costs and benefits of infrastructure adaptation, using benefit-cost ratios (BCRs) and spatial analysis. Risk visualization tools are used to assess flood exposure. Longitudinal accounting of public transaction costs is considered for policy performance. Protocol-based modular frameworks, interdisciplinary modeling hierarchies, and multi-model ensembles are used. Insurers can contribute to adaptation through underwriting and pricing. Catastrophe models implement vulnerability curves with and without flood-resilience technologies. Approaches include assuming autonomous vulnerability reduction or projecting forward from planned adaptation. Multi-criteria analysis coupled with uncertainty analysis identifies preferable solutions. Adaptation process frameworks involve integrated modeling to assess risks, vulnerabilities, and the performance of adaptation options. Decision support systems use algorithms like CART to identify critical score values, and stress the search for robust options under conditions of uncertainty.","Adaptation modeling is vital but complex, lacking a universal metric due to sector-specific measures, regional vulnerabilities, and societal choices. Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) are evolving to incorporate adaptation. Cross-sectoral interdependencies are critical to consider. RCP4.5 may be optimal for long-term climate stabilization. Adaptation can turn negative climate impacts on sectors like forestry positive, although farm size constraints can limit adaptation benefits for smallholders, revealing macro-micro discrepancies. Heat-induced productivity losses can be partially mitigated by autonomous mechanization. Top-down and bottom-up approaches need better integration, especially proactive adaptation in macroeconomic models. Enhancing the climate service sector and European-level coordination is crucial.

Climate services are essential for supporting solutions, actions, and climate-related missions. Model validation requires more than historical data; global sensitivity analysis improves transparency and stakeholder confidence. Global scenarios are relevant for long-term planning, while local factors dominate in the short-to-mid-term. Dominant drivers of coastal defence vulnerability change over time. Models can apply credible climate changes to overcome the limitations of stress-testing. Robustness and resilience frameworks identify trade-offs and breakpoints for decision-making. Reducing uncertainty in agricultural climate projections is important. Models can evaluate the effectiveness of Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) measures, emphasizing cost-benefit analysis (including ecosystem services) and accounting for indirect impacts. Model-based risk assessment is advantageous for updating as new scenarios emerge.

Agricultural adaptation is needed to minimize yield losses. Integrated flood risk management reduces vulnerability. Understanding key drivers of change in flood risk requires comparing flood events. Climate-fit.City provides urban climate data for better decision-making. Weather-based insurance (WII) can promote resilience in farming, support zero hunger, reduce inequalities, and advance climate action. Imperfect forecasts can lead to frequent income fluctuations. Climate risk models often inadequately account for cascading failures in infrastructure. Socio-hydrological models bridge the gap of conventional hydroeconomic models. The interaction between adaptation and mitigation in land use and food systems requires more focus. LandSyMM can assess the impact of climate change and land management on crop yields, land allocation, food security, and trade.

High uncertainty exists in future water availability. Economically efficient adaptation integrates hydrologic, engineering, environmental, and economic aspects. Data-driven models are needed to identify spatial network vulnerabilities for decision-making. A high-level screening can compare the efficacy of different adaptation options. Adaptation investments in transport networks yield substantial benefits. Improved hazard modeling and data in risk visualization tools are needed. Policies need to be robust to foreseeable and unforeseen changes. Standard probabilistic decision-making is no longer appropriate; robustness is key. Stakeholder integration is crucial in method and results generation. Transitional risks present both challenges and opportunities for businesses. Transition risks must be expected in the private sector. Sustainable finance action plans and the European taxonomy on sustainable finance help steer investments toward low-carbon assets.

Insurers can play a role in climate change adaptation through underwriting and pricing practices and should consider integrating risk reduction measures in insurance products. Flood-resilience measures can reduce insurance premiums. Improved modeling and extended insurance coverage are needed to address the protection gap for Business Interruption (BI) risks. Insurers can reduce insured risk and vulnerability to payment defaults. Many models have insufficient spatial-temporal resolution for adaptation policy decisions. Integration of information on exposure and vulnerability is needed for more realistic risk projections. Mortality rates from storm surge floods have declined, but risks remain high in the Pacific and Southeast Asia. Changes in vulnerability need to be accounted for in risk projections. Adaptation action can be limited by local capacities, leading to soft adaptation limits. Current climate risk products may not fully inform adaptation due to insufficient inclusion of autonomous risk processes, equity considerations, and adaptation limits.

Impact chains are useful for risk analysis, communication, and identifying entry points for adaptation. They have been applied in national climate risk assessments. Vulnerability and exposure factors are complex and context-specific. Impact chains highlight impacting mechanisms related to different hazards, pinpointing causal relationships. An operational approach to include global change drivers in the design of local policies or investment plans is needed. Climate risks need to be included in medium-to-long-term decisions. Decision-making for climate change adaptation is affected by deep uncertainty. Modelling outputs need to be integrated with other sources of knowledge and implemented within an integrated platform for decision support.","The EU's climate adaptation strategy emphasizes developing and implementing solutions, moving beyond simply understanding the problem. Adaptation involves a mix of interventions, including difficult-to-model non-technical options like capacity building. IAMs explore geoengineering and incorporate endogenous growth theories, but the success of adaptation depends on regional and societal vulnerabilities and capabilities. Economic studies often neglect remote impacts of climate adaptation, presenting challenges for incorporating adaptation into macroeconomic models. Adaptation involves cross-regional and cross-sectoral mobility of labor and capital and input/commodity substitutability. Impacts vary greatly across regions and RCPs. Mechanization and air conditioning mitigate heat stress impacts on productivity and GDP via autonomous adaptation, but implementing adaptation in CGE models without proactive elements is challenging.

Research supported by EU Horizon 2020 and exemplified by CICERO reports focuses on Norwegian research. Further assessment is needed regarding investments in the European Roadmap and the climate service market. Dutch climate change scenarios condense global projections into policy narratives. Global sensitivity analysis can supplement historical data in model validation. Failing to incorporate wave setup uncertainty may invalidate conclusions. Field-based adaptation stress-testing is limited by observation period conditions. Integrated adaptation planning should be mindful of multiple drivers of environmental change and use a water lens. Handling uncertainties in agricultural projections is crucial. Climate change effects must be incorporated into DRR modelling. Data access and quality, knowledge transfer, and understanding vulnerability relationships are vital. Stakeholder engagement and co-exploration of model capabilities are essential. Crop rotation diversification increases crop resilience, but knowledge about vulnerability and risk drivers is scarce.

Services may focus on the urban scale or require high-resolution data, like mortality data for heat-health services. Research focuses on agriculture in developing countries and weather index insurance (WII), recommending crop- and region-specific models incorporating real-world data and probabilistic forecasts. Climate change trends should be incorporated into WII models. Food system actors autonomously adapt based on economic drivers, requiring policy measures for mitigation. Agricultural adaptation may not be environmentally synergistic, and autonomous adaptation prioritizes economic interests. There is a lack of focus on the interactions between climate change mitigation and adaptation in the land system.

Methodologies and case studies from ITRC inform stakeholders about changing risks, contributing to national strategies and NDCs. Open-source tools exist for transport risk and adaptation analysis in Argentina and Vietnam. Detailed regional climate information is crucial in hazard models, and BCRs are important in adaptation investments. Deep uncertainty in human-water systems requires robust decision-making integrating socio-hydrology and institutional economics. Increasing model complexity can compound uncertainty, requiring better model and scenario representation. Improving economic performance is needed to induce transition in water resource management. Companies need to assess, disclose, and reduce GHG emissions, emphasizing transparency concerning climate-related risks. Insurance can incentivize adaptation through lower premiums for flood-resilient properties. Standard business interruption (BI) insurance often lacks individual risk assessment, and catastrophe models are less developed for BI than property damage. Risk-based premiums and data sharing are crucial for insurability.

Climate change impact, vulnerability, and adaptation assessments can strain smaller administrations' resources. Current climate risk products may fall short of informing adaptation decisions on the ground, limited by local capacities and governance. Comparing future risks against past trends is important, as is understanding vulnerability reductions from adaptation. Frameworks have been applied in national risk assessments worldwide (e.g., Burundi, Bangladesh). Stakeholder involvement and shared conceptual models are essential. Economic signals prevail in the shorter term, and climatic signals in the longer term, impacting investment decisions and adaptation policies. Effective adaptation policies require substantial financial investment and may introduce distributive effects.",Macroeconomic/Fiscal,,Acute shocks,Adaptive,Regional,Sequential Interactions,Transitional (accounting for changes over time),,"Adaptation is considered through a variety of modeling approaches that address complexity, uncertainty, and risk management related to climate impacts. Integrated Assessment Models and Computable General Equilibrium models are applied across sectors to incorporate economic analysis, cost-benefit assessment, and adaptation strategy evaluation.

Socio-economic factors and infrastructure investment are analyzed using cost-benefit ratios to prioritize adaptation options. Multi-criteria and uncertainty analyses guide decision-making, focusing on technical performance and stakeholder acceptance. Frameworks support participatory processes, stress-testing, and learning for adaptation performance assessment.

Higher damages disproportionately impact the Global South, significantly affecting regional GDP distribution, and potentially leading to economic contraction in poorer regions. Temperature variability increases uncertainty in SCCO2 estimates and can widen SCCO2 distributions. The persistence of climate change impacts is a critical factor, heavily influencing the SCCO2; high persistence can lead to lower mean SCCO2 or methodological issues dominating the model. Adaptation is crucial for reducing the SCCO2 by diminishing damage persistence. SCCO2 estimates are sensitive to model specifications, SSP scenarios, equity weighting, discount rates, and the tolerability of discontinuities. Empirical analysis shows the effect of temperature and temperature squared on GDP per capita growth, with varying temperature lags affecting estimates of damage persistence. Temperature has a statistically significant impact on GDP per capita growth in some models, especially those related to lagged temperature effects on GDP, driven by regions with lower GDP per capita. Increased interannual temperature variability is found over the tropics, but not enough global region-specific evidence justifies increasing or decreasing temperature variability with rising global temperatures in simulations.","This study investigates the sensitivity of the Social Cost of Carbon (SCCO2) using the PAGE-ICE integrated assessment model (IAM), built within the Mimi framework, under the SSP2-RCP4.5 scenario. It focuses on refining climate-economy feedbacks, including temperature variability, growth effects (especially in the Global South), and damage persistence, while acknowledging adaptation's role. The analysis explores how these factors influence the SCCO2 and its uncertainty, highlighting the limitations of simple IAM representations. Key aspects include: modeling temperature variability globally and regionally; capping total climate change damages, which can affect SCCO2 at high persistence levels; examining the impact of adaptation on reducing damage persistence; and using historical data to derive temperature-induced damages and their persistence. The study recognizes that future adaptation levels are implicitly assumed to be at current levels for economic damages and that more research is needed to advance the understanding of damage persistence and adaptation mechanisms, especially in the Global South. The analysis employs extrapolation methods for population and income levels past 2100 and considers the interaction of temperature variability with temperature-damage functions. It acknowledges limitations in extrapolating historical persistence into future scenarios, and investigates spatial heterogeneity using PPP measures and methodologies such as low-pass filtering to estimate persistence, discarding countries with short data series, but ultimately finds inconclusive evidence for heterogeneous persistence. The analysis also highlights the importance of using accurate damage functions (% of GDP vs % of GDP per capita), and notes that exogenous population assumptions are present.

The ARDL model addresses endogeneity, multicollinearity, heteroscedasticity, and autocorrelation. Unit root tests (ADF, PP, KPSS) are employed. Optimal lag length is determined using criteria like AIC, SC, or HQ. Cointegration is assessed using a bound F-statistic test and VAR in polynomial graph for lag selection. Impulse Response Function (IRF) analysis and variance decomposition (using Cholesky factors) are used to assess dynamic effects and the impact of shocks. Panel data analysis, VAR approaches, econometric estimation, meta-regression analysis, correlation analysis, co-integration models, and instrumental variables approaches are also mentioned, alongside a qualitative discussion and review of quantitative projections and working papers. Analytical models are referenced to assess the effects of rainfall fluctuation on sectoral and economic growth, though the models themselves are not specified here.","Saudi Arabia faces intricate macroeconomic and macro-fiscal challenges influenced by climate change and environmental variables. Economic growth is intertwined with macroeconomic factors such as unemployment, inflation, population, and environmental variables including carbon emissions, rainfall, and temperature. Unemployment and temperature positively influence GDP growth, whereas carbon emissions and rainfall negatively affect it. The effects of these variables on economic growth remain inconclusive globally, with mixed findings across different studies and regions.

Modern technologies to mitigate weather-related impacts are crucial for sustaining growth. The country must balance economic growth with reducing carbon emissions and adapting to climate variations. Utilizing advanced scientific approaches to manage temperature and rainfall is recommended for boosting growth. Additionally, the shift towards green energy offers a viable economic path amid challenges like dependence on foreign labor and high local unemployment, which threaten Saudi Arabia’s stability.

Cointegration analysis shows a significant long-run relationship among these variables with GDP. Despite some exogenous shocks not being detected, variance decomposition indicates that carbon emissions, unemployment, and inflation strongly respond to growth dynamics, whereas rainfall, temperature, and population do not. The analysis underscores the importance of long-term strategic adjustments in fiscal and environmental policies to enhance economic resilience and stability.","This study examines the impact of environmental and macroeconomic factors on Saudi Arabia's economic growth between 1990 and 2019, using data from the World Bank and Saudi Arabian sources.

Methodologically, it employs several approaches: (1) a fiscal reaction function with panel data analysis of Pacific Islands, regressing primary balance on lagged primary balance and debt-to-GDP ratio (including a quadratic term) and robustness checks using terms of trade; (2) a debt sustainability framework incorporating natural disaster shocks and analyzing debt dynamics via a government's cash-flow constraint, expressed as shares of GDP, focuses on steady-state debt level affected by average disaster impacts; (3) theoretical analysis of natural disasters' impact on long-term growth and steady-state debt, using debt equations and examining effects on economic parameters; (4) Calibration of debt and budget balance targets and expenditure rules, with PNG as an example; (5) Analysis of different fiscal rules (debt, budget balance, expenditure, revenue, and cash buffer targets) using both empirical and normative approaches and stochastic simulations; (6) Examination of fiscal rules excluding volatile resource revenue to avoid procyclicality, including stabilization funds, cash buffers, and escape clauses as risk management tools, drawing parallels to inflation targeting in monetary policy. The analysis uses various assumptions related to revenue-to-GDP ratio targets and steady-state budget balance before disaster, and assumes some deviation from the target is acceptable.","Pacific Island Countries (PICs) face significant macroeconomic and fiscal risks from climate change and natural disasters, exacerbated by limited economic diversification and procyclical fiscal policies. Fiscal rules are crucial for reducing procyclicality and maintaining fiscal sustainability, particularly debt rules to prevent sovereign defaults. However, existing fiscal rules rarely incorporate climate change. A nonlinear relationship exists between debt and primary balance in PICs, suggesting a debt limit beyond which debt becomes unsustainable. Maintaining debt below steady-state is key, and the primary balance influences this level. Disaster impacts on growth and risk premiums are ambiguous; natural disasters can negatively impact growth, especially in low-income countries, while technological shocks during recovery or climate change-induced dampening can alter long-run growth and debt levels. Expenditure rules, especially recurrent spending rules based on stable revenue (non-resource, non-grant), are preferable to GDP-based rules for reducing procyclicality and GDP volatility. These rules should exclude net acquisition of non-financial assets to allow for post-disaster infrastructure rebuilding. A natural disaster-resilient fiscal rule should allow for fiscal stimulus in response to disasters, with public investment determined by realized shock values. Volatile resource revenues should be excluded from fiscal rules. Stabilization funds, cash buffers, and carefully managed escape clauses are important for fiscal risk management. A recurrent expenditure rule, linked to debt and budget balance targets, may be the most useful fiscal rule in PICs for handling natural disasters, volatile revenues, and uncertain grants.","The IMF paper focuses on fiscal policy recommendations for small island developing states, particularly in the Pacific, that are vulnerable to climate change and natural disasters. It proposes a practically applicable fiscal rule framework, using PNG as a case study due to its reliance on commodities, grants, and its frequent exposure to climatic shocks. The analysis uses panel data and examines the nonlinear relationship between primary balance and relevant factors, acknowledging the importance of remittances and concessional debt in mitigating disaster impacts. The proposed fiscal rules utilize non-resource, non-grant revenue as a base, especially for expenditure ceilings, and implicitly considers adaptation through debt and budget management. It highlights the limited research on fiscal rules incorporating natural disasters in Pacific Island countries. The analysis also notes that foreign aid for disaster relief is often insufficient and delayed, and that disaster-related infrastructure replacement may not always lead to economic improvement. Country-specific tailoring of debt targets and fiscal rules is crucial, given the potential impact of climate change.

A two-stage least-squares regression analysis, using rainfall deviations as instrumental variables, addresses endogeneity. The analysis considers current and lagged impacts, groups states based on geography, hydrogeology, and GSDP, and uses explanatory variables like the percentage area exposed to floods and droughts.","Floods and droughts have varied impacts across India's regions. Floods tend to positively influence non-agriculture sector GSDP, whereas droughts generally have a negative impact on GSDP, particularly in non-agricultural sectors, and can adversely affect HDI. There is no significant impact of floods or droughts on HDI at a national level, though massive investments in flood mitigation and adaptation have enhanced GDP and HDI in Eastern Region (ER) states. A shift in focus from national to sub-national assessments reveals the significance of regional analysis. Assam, with frequent flood exposure, shows a reduction in its impact over two decades due to infrastructure improvements, as seen in Bihar. Similarly, Gujarat and Rajasthan demonstrate reduced drought exposure due to mitigation efforts. The exposure trends influence sectoral GSDP, with some regions like Northwest Region (NWR) showing resilience or benefits from flood exposure in non-agricultural sectors. Investments in flood mitigation and infrastructure help reduce poverty in ER states while diversification and water management strategies boost GSDP in other regions. Groundwater recharge from floods can offset some of their negative impacts, highlighting regional adaptation strategies' importance for sustainable growth.","This study profiles disaster impacts at the district level to improve mitigation and adaptation efforts, focusing on hydrogeological differences and water usage in agriculture.

A combination of correlation analyses, stepwise, and Lasso regressions is used to understand the dynamics of climate impacts on TFPC. The study includes geospatial analyses to pinpoint regions significantly affected by climate variables, utilizing seasonal averages and 20-year running correlation analyses. Climate projections using CMIP5 under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios help forecast future TFPC responses, with model simulations estimating climate impacts assuming constant adaptation practices. The research extends relevant models to the US agricultural sector and involves global crop model intercomparisons and regression-based ensemble means to validate projections against historical climate and economic data until anomalies exceed historical levels. Additionally, GCM projections and 28-year regression submodels further inform the analysis.","Climate change significantly impacts agricultural Total Factor Productivity (TFP), with sensitivity increasing markedly after 1980. Warmer temperatures during summer in the agricultural heartland now negatively correlate with TFP, while warmer temperatures in specific California regions show positive correlations. Projections indicate substantial TFP losses, potentially reverting to pre-1980 levels by 2050 if current trends continue, with climate penalties expected to intensify TFP reductions. While irrigation has historically buffered against precipitation changes, future water scarcity may worsen TFP losses. Adaptation strategies offer potential for mitigating TFP losses, although their effects remain unpredictable. Climate scenario RCP8.5 projects more severe negative impacts on the measured variable compared to RCP4.5, particularly in the 2030-2040 period.","This study analyzes the impact of climate change on US agricultural total factor productivity (TFP) through 2050 under RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, projecting a declining TFP trend. TFP is more sensitive to climate change than yields alone due to increased costs associated with maintaining those yields. Regional climate impacts are complex and crop-dependent, with heat stress negatively affecting grain crops and confined animal operations. Increased reliance on crop production, which is more weather-sensitive than livestock, makes TFP more susceptible to climate. Key factors driving the climate penalty are rising summer temperatures in the agricultural heartland. The analysis does not account for evolving climate sensitivity, adaptation measures, or fully established policy effects like biofuel mandates, and finds limited evidence that international trade can reverse TFP loss. Uncertainty in climate projections is represented using the 25th and 75th percentile GCM results. Technological improvements, adaptation, and CO2 fertilization are considered as long-term factors influencing TFP growth, but the models don't account for evolving climate sensitivity or adaptation measures.

These risks manifest across multiple sectors and geographies, with effects including reduced GDP growth following tropical cyclone exposure, particularly in regions historically less affected, and temperature's nonlinear impact on economic production. While adaptation can theoretically mitigate losses, current climate conditions already exert a considerable economic and social burden comparable to future projections, and adaptation technologies can be prohibitively expensive. Warming trends already negatively affect global GDP growth, and future climate change is projected to significantly impact agricultural yields, GDP, and total factor productivity globally, particularly in vulnerable regions.

While the effects of climate change on global economic growth are inconclusive, developing countries, particularly SSA, show distinct vulnerabilities and responses compared to developed nations. Developed countries mitigate these risks through infrastructure investments. Climate variability is sometimes more important than climate means and can represent a substantial handicap to economic output. Models indicate that drought indices are consistently significant predictors of economic growth. Temperature's impact is less consistent, particularly when precipitation is considered.

It projects cholera burden attributable to climate change by 2030 using econometric analyses within the Chiabai et al. framework, linking climate change, population growth, and economic development. Future cholera deaths are estimated by downscaling regional diarrheal death projections, applying Tanzania's cholera/diarrheal death ratio, and using a case fatality rate to estimate cases. Economic costs are calculated by multiplying climate change-attributable cases by the unit cost per case (reactive adaptation), and productivity losses are estimated based on lost workdays and wages. A GDP-adjusted Value of Statistical Life (VOSL) is used for mortality costs. Scenarios of 1°C and 2°C temperature increases by 2030 inform projections, using both annual and monthly data to generate cost boundaries. Cost estimates rely on Tanzanian Ministry of Health data and exclude preventative measure costs assuming integration within general socio-economic development and autonomous adaptation effects.

Temperature increases are positively correlated with cholera cases. Reactive adaptation costs for cholera management in Tanzania could be reduced by 44-47% if temperature increase is limited to 1°C instead of 2°C. By 2030, these costs are estimated at 0.03-0.12% of GDP, with loss of lives accounting for 90% of the total. These costs are significantly higher than current budgets for diarrheal diseases.

However, it implied that preventative measures, potentially including ""soft options"", were assumed to be implemented with general socioeconomic development. This suggests that these interventions could be integral to the broader strategy of reducing vulnerability to cholera, albeit not directly specified or analyzed in the study's cost estimation. The importance of strengthening health systems, a possible outcome of institutional interventions, was considered in the national-level assessment of future economic developments, pointing to indirect acknowledgment of their benefits.","This paper focuses on the economic costs of climate change-induced cholera in Tanzania. It doesn't explicitly define ""sufficient adaptation levels."" Instead, it estimates the economic costs *after* reactive adaptation (treatment of cholera cases) but *before* preventative adaptation, which it assumes will be integrated into general socioeconomic development and strengthening of the health system. Therefore, ""well-adapted"" in this context would imply a state where the remaining (post-reactive adaptation) cholera burden attributable to climate change is minimized, ideally approaching zero through broader development efforts. The study does not quantify preventative adaptation costs, making it difficult to determine the level needed for 'sufficient adaptation'.

The analysis uses annual changes in temperature and precipitation levels. Temperature data are population-weighted. The DICE model is also used to explore climate change's effect on technological progress. Projections based on historical data are extrapolated to predict future warming's impact on TFP growth. The impact is assessed through semi-elasticity estimates and not long-run estimates.","Highlights: Temperature shocks negatively impact TFP growth, primarily in poor countries. This impact diminishes as income levels rise, becoming negligible above specific thresholds (approximately $14,900 - $34,400 depending on the country's classification as ""hot"" or ""not hot""). Climate change can reduce output, savings, and investment and permanently reduce future output possibilities through TFP effects. The negative impact is concentrated on TFP growth and labor productivity growth in poorer nations, with empirical evidence suggesting persistence of these impacts. While there's a correlation between temperature and TFP, causality isn't established, and the relationship appears non-linear.","The study investigates the impact of temperature on TFP growth, distinguishing between static and dynamic effects and highlighting the compounding effects of growth reductions. It links macro-level data (Penn World Table 8.1) with micro-level insights on temperature's impact on human physiology and labor productivity, especially in poorer countries. Potential measurement errors in TFP due to weather-related economic reallocations are acknowledged. Robustness checks reveal heterogeneous impacts based on climate, development levels, institutional quality (Polity2), and TFP composition, with income levels being a key moderator. Temperature's effect on TFP growth is found to be dependent on GDP per capita, institutional quality, and sectoral composition (e.g., agriculture). Using RCP 8.5 warming projections (2071-2095 vs. 1980-2004), the findings confirm that poorer countries will disproportionately suffer, although the estimated TFP reduction (5.30%) is considered an upper bound. The analysis uses interaction terms with GDP per capita and temperature categories to capture these heterogeneous effects.

The analysis focuses on the relationship between country-level TFP and green-season temperature and precipitation, using response functions and various modeling choices like revenue regression weights. The impact of removing 10% of the hottest countries is also shown.","The study investigates the impact of weather changes on Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth, considering technological change and regional variations.

The study highlights limitations concerning TFP metrics, such as the exclusion of factors like CO2 concentration effects and agricultural research.

The regressions often include state and year fixed effects, a lagged dependent variable, and control for precipitation, temperature volatility, and spatial correlation (using methods like Conley (1999) or Hsiang (2010)). States are commonly weighted by their relative GSP. Standard errors are frequently clustered by year, state, or both dimensions. Robustness checks involve alternative weights (population, area, time-varying GSP), alternative GSP measures (per-capita, real, private industries), alternative temperature data/aggregation (population-weighted, different deseasonalization), alternative season definitions (core months), and exclusion of outliers (Alaska, Hawaii). Growth versus level regressions and Wald tests for lagged temperature effects are also employed. Some analyses divide the U.S. into regions or pre/post-1997 periods (SIC/NAICS classification change). Arellano-Bond estimation is used as a robustness check in some cases. Historical panel regression coefficients are sometimes combined with future climate projections to estimate long-term GDP impacts. Some analyses examine state development levels using the Human Development Index (HDI) as an interaction term.","Seasonal temperatures, particularly summer temperatures, have a significant negative impact on U.S. economic growth at both the national and industry levels, with a stronger effect post-1990. A 1°F increase in summer temperature reduces state-level output growth by 0.15 to 0.25 percentage points and negatively affects sectors like finance, insurance, real estate, agriculture, wholesale, construction, retail, and communication, though utilities and mining show positive effects due to higher energy demand. Lagged summer temperatures also negatively impact growth, whereas fall temperatures have a positive, albeit less robust, effect. High summer temperatures decrease labor productivity and increase health-related costs, further impacting sectors. These temperature changes might reduce economic growth by up to a third of the historical average U.S. GDP growth rate under high emissions. Regional differences are noted, with Southern states experiencing significant impacts. Significant negative impacts are observed in agriculture, forestry, fishing, professional and business services, and food services, especially post-1997. Data show that GDP growth rates are strongly autocorrelated with significant correlations between seasonal temperature changes affecting macroeconomic stability.","This analysis, focused on the United States from 1957-2012 (primarily 1960-2012), examines the impact of temperature on state-level GSP growth. Using panel regressions with state and year fixed effects and clustered standard errors, the study finds that summer temperatures, particularly in the South, have a pervasive effect on a large cross-section of private industries through productivity growth. The effect of summer temperature is more robust than fall temperature. The study uses data from multiple weather stations and assesses robustness to various definitions of seasons, aggregation methods, and other factors. Industry classification changes post-1997 require caution in data handling. Different emission scenarios are used to project the long-term impact of rising temperatures on U.S. economic growth, weighting states by GSP (with alternatives explored). Robustness checks include excluding lagged GSP and noncontiguous states. Agriculture shows an intuitive effect but contributes little to national GDP, while construction shows some negative impacts with lesser significance. More developed states might have industries more exposed to summer weather.

Paleoclimate data indicates higher frequencies and intensities of severe cyclones than instrumental records suggest, with long-term natural variability influencing TC activity in Australia. Sunspot number shows a negative correlation with U.S. hurricane counts and intensity. SST is a significant predictor of Atlantic basin hurricane numbers, though its relationship with landfalling hurricanes is less clear. Climate models predict increases in TC counts in certain regions and show varying patterns of TC genesis changes with future warming. Increased CO2 leads to regional patterns of SST warming and altered precipitation patterns, potentially reducing convective precipitation in the tropics.

Economic analyses demonstrate that hurricane losses increase non-linearly with intensity, and adaptation strategies can mitigate indirect losses. The landfall proportion for stronger hurricanes is smaller in warm years for certain genesis sub-regions. Aerosols affect cloud microstructure and TC intensity, decreasing convection near the eye wall. Relational aspects of hurricane activity can be understood using networks, and latitudinal migration of atmospheric systems influences landfall locations. Economic Amplification Ratio (EAR) increases with disaster size, emphasizing the importance of resilient economies with diverse supply chains. Reconstruction speed is often limited by shortages of skilled workers. Disasters can spur productivity improvements through technology upgrades. Indirect costs of extreme events are significant, and ""no-regret"" adaptation strategies offer benefits even without changes in hurricane frequency or intensity. Uncertainty estimates and economic dynamics are critical in assessing climate change impacts.","The document examines various aspects of tropical cyclone (TC) behavior, prediction, and impacts, acknowledging limitations and uncertainties. It explores reconstructing past TC activity using geological evidence and proxies like coastal ridges and lightning.

*   **Panel Data Models:** Fixed effects models, linear and non-linear (quadratic, fractional polynomial) specifications, and models with country fixed effects and country-specific trends are applied. Estimators like XTSPJ (half-panel jackknife fixed effects) are used. Both growth and levels specifications are considered.

*   **Robustness:** Standard errors are clustered by province and region-year (NUTS3) to account for spatial correlation. Bootstrapping is used to calculate confidence intervals and maximizing GDP growth temperatures.

A Vector Auto-Regressive (VAR) model and structural VAR (SVAR) approach are employed to evaluate the interaction between weather shocks and macroeconomic variables, incorporating constraints relevant to New Zealand's economic context. A Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model, with a focus on weather-dependent agricultural productivity, is utilized to simulate the effect of weather and climate change on sectoral outputs and broader economic metrics. 

This model is estimated using Bayesian methods, with parameters drawn from approaches by Smets and Wouters and others, using techniques like the Kalman filter and Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to ensure robust estimation. Empirical evidence on weather impacts is grounded in real business cycle theories, including productivity effects due to temperature variations. The analysis further includes an exploration of sectoral shifts due to droughts and uses a variance decomposition to gauge the impact of different shocks over multiple time horizons.

Simulations compare historical and future scenarios by adjusting weather shock variability according to climate projections, with climate models providing granular data under various Representative Concentration Pathways. Outputs are assessed through impulse response functions (IRFs), variance decompositions, and historical business cycle decompositions. Welfare impacts are evaluated by estimating consumption losses in an economy free of weather shocks, offering insights into the costs of climate variability and adaptation benefits. These methodologies collectively reconcile theoretical models with empirical data, allowing for comprehensive analysis of weather-induced economic volatility.","New Zealand's economy is significantly impacted by weather shocks, particularly droughts, which reduce GDP and agricultural output and incur welfare costs. Climate change amplifies these effects, increasing macroeconomic volatility, especially in agricultural-based economies. Adverse weather leads to contractions in agricultural production, consumption, and investment, while increasing hours worked, playing a non-trivial role in business cycles. These shocks mimic TFP shocks, displaying persistent effects, particularly in the labor market, and affect the real exchange rate, trade balance, and current account. The impact propagates through land expenditure costs and is amplified by low decay rates of land productivity and increased labor reallocation costs. Climate change increases the variance of weather shocks, leading to greater macroeconomic volatility and welfare costs, with more severe climate scenarios resulting in more negative welfare outcomes. Even with moderate risk aversion, the welfare cost of weather shocks is significant due to hysteresis effects. A theoretical model, using soil moisture deficits as a weather index, emphasizes the importance of weather conditions for generating business cycles, necessitating a high damage function parameter. Data inform the posterior distributions of key parameters, particularly the land-weather elasticity parameter.","This analysis, specific to New Zealand, uses a two-sector (agricultural and non-agricultural) dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model to examine the short-term macroeconomic effects and welfare costs of weather shocks, particularly droughts, under different climate scenarios. It differentiates itself from integrated assessment models by focusing on micro-founded mechanisms of weather shock propagation. The model incorporates a soil moisture deficit index to monitor severe weather events and treats weather as an exogenous process, assuming limited impact from human activities due to data limitations. It analyzes fluctuations, considers labor mobility across sectors, and evaluates scenarios with varying drought variance. Results are likely exacerbated in developing economies with larger agricultural sectors and lower capital intensity.

The impacts are more pronounced in warmer regions like Africa and the Near East and have intensified over time. Agricultural productivity is increasingly sensitive to higher temperatures and changes in weather, particularly during the green season, as shown through various response functions and tests.

While some sectors like utilities and mining may benefit from increased energy consumption, others, especially agriculture, forestry, fishing, retail, wholesale, real estate, insurance, construction, and services, are negatively affected. The impact on sectors like real estate, retail, and insurance is more pronounced in the post-1997 period.

Although regional variations exist (with some initial findings suggesting a positive effect in the South later refuted), the overall negative impact of summer temperatures on GSP growth is robust across various specifications and robustness checks, potentially reducing economic growth by a significant fraction of historical averages under high emission scenarios. Lagged summer temperatures also exhibit a significant negative impact. The negative impact of summer temperatures on productivity appears to be a major driver of the overall effect.","Page 1-50 notes focus on U.S. macroeconomic and macro-fiscal risks related to climate change, specifically the effects of temperature variations on state-level GSP growth, primarily in southern states.

Macroeconomic analysis relies on Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) models, including variance decomposition, impulse response functions (IRFs), and counterfactual analysis to simulate the effects of weather shocks on GDP, CPI, interest rates, and credit. Identification of shocks uses Cholesky decomposition. Firm-level analysis involves panel regressions with firm and time fixed effects, often including lagged ACI, to examine the impact of climate risk on financial indicators like bank loans, expected default frequency (EDF), and firm value-added. Robustness checks include placebo tests, resampling, and alternative climate indices. Some analyses also examine the interaction of climate risk with monetary policy, macroeconomic variables, and firm heterogeneity. Various control variables are employed, and standard errors are made robust.","Extreme weather events, as measured by the Chinese ACI, negatively impact China's GDP, CPI, and firm-level output, especially for non-state-owned, younger, and smaller firms. These shocks reduce credit access by increasing firm-level default risk, depressing market expectations, and leading to analyst downgrades and reduced profit forecasts. The effects are amplified by economic policy uncertainty, financial stress, and tighter monetary policy. While short-term monetary easing is insufficient to counter long-term effects, intervention can mitigate the output impact. Specific climate factors like extreme temperatures, concentrated precipitation, and drought negatively correlate with firm-level financing, while strong winds have positive effects. Adaptation can mitigate negative impacts.

The methodology involves estimating regression models (OLS and negative binomial) to relate disaster damages/deaths to factors explaining the unmitigated impact, controlling for intensity, exposure, demand effects, and efficiency factors (institutional quality, income inequality, education, health, government expenditure, openness, financial sector development). Explanatory variables are often lagged to address endogeneity, and standard errors are clustered at the country level. Data from the Munich Re NatCat database is used, aggregated to the country-year level. Logarithmic transformations are frequently applied. An efficiency index is calculated based on statistically significant factors predicting deaths per disaster and used to rank countries; rank correlation between tropical cyclone and flood rankings is also calculated. Stochastic frontier analysis was considered but rejected. The analysis aims to identify countries with weak adaptation efficiency spill-overs, although methodological and data limitations are acknowledged. Results and applicability are limited to included countries and time periods, and countries with similar characteristics and flood exposure.","Highlights: Lower-income countries are more vulnerable to climate change due to exposure, sensitivity, and adaptation deficits. Adaptation deficits stem from a demand effect (desire for 'climate security' increases with income) and an efficiency effect (adaptation is more productive in wealthier countries). Lower adaptation efficiency is linked to less government spending, income inequality, and poor governance. Floods and tropical cyclones are the primary climate-related drivers of disaster deaths and economic damage. Disaster losses are negatively associated with long-term hazard exposure, which incentivizes adaptation. Higher GDP per capita and better political institutions reduce disaster deaths, while higher inequality increases them. Specific factors like investment profile and religious/military influence affect flood/cyclone deaths. Higher GDP per capita reduces economic damage from floods and cyclones, but magnitude and total GDP increase damage. Inequality can decrease flood damage (location effect) but increases cyclone damage. Better institutions increase cyclone damage. Trade openness reduces cyclone losses. Adaptation efficiency varies by country, with Northern Europe performing well, the US underperforming, and some developing countries surprisingly efficient. Demand for adaptation increases with income, and adaptation efficiency varies with government spending, institutional quality, and income distribution. Closing adaptation deficits requires both general growth and targeted assistance. Factors like flood magnitude, population, GDP per capita, government expenditure, and income inequality significantly influence flood-related deaths. Cyclone magnitude, population, area, GDP per capita, cyclone propensity, and government expenditure affect cyclone-related deaths. Higher GDP and life expectancy correlate with increased economic damages, while higher Gini index values correlate with decreased damages. Magnitude, total GDP, area, GDP per capita, Gini, political risk, socioeconomic condition, and credit/GDP are statistically significant determinants of economic damage. Country efficiency rankings for flood death reduction are provided.","This study explores the 'adaptation deficit', aiming to identify adaptation inefficiencies in poorer countries and suggesting targeted support and inclusive growth policies. It utilizes the Munich Re NatCat database for disaster loss data, arguing for its superiority over EM-DAT due to broader coverage. The analysis primarily focuses on disaster-related deaths (especially from floods and cyclones) as a proxy for adaptation capacity and risk, acknowledging the indirect link to macroeconomic and fiscal variables. The study identifies income as a key driver of climate security through demand and efficiency effects, highlighting the complex relationship between inequality, economic damages, and potential biases in data collection. Key limitations include the focus on deaths rather than direct economic impacts, the exclusion of certain disaster types (droughts, heatwaves, earthquakes), data limitations, and potential endogeneity issues in location decisions. The study models risk and adaptation through demand and efficiency factors, noting that the relationship between economic growth and climate resilience requires further analysis. While general government expenditure is used, it may not fully capture dedicated disaster management spending. The dependent variable ""Economic Damages"" units are not specified.",Adaptation,,,,,,,,,"The paper primarily analyzes the macroeconomic impact of climate-related natural disasters (tropical cyclones and floods) on countries, focusing on economic damages and lives lost. While it explores factors influencing these impacts (institutional quality, income inequality, etc.) and discusses adaptation, it does not specifically identify particular economic sectors that are most affected.","The paper indirectly quantifies the benefits of adaptation by estimating the ""adaptation deficit"" through regression analysis. It analyzes the relationship between disaster damages/deaths and various factors, including income, institutional quality, and other socio-economic variables, controlling for event intensity and exposure. By examining how these factors influence the impact of disasters, the paper infers the level of adaptation effort and identifies countries with higher/lower ""efficiency"" in disaster management. This efficiency is calculated and ranked, providing a relative measure of adaptation benefits across countries. The core approach involves using regression models to normalize disaster impacts (damages/deaths) with respect to factors determining the unmitigated impact, and the remaining variation is then attributed to adaptation efforts.","This paper quantifies the costs of adaptation indirectly through econometric analysis. It estimates the impact of climate-related disasters (tropical cyclones and floods) on economic damages and lives lost, then uses regression analysis to control for event intensity, exposure, demand effects, and various ""efficiency factors"" (institutional quality, income, education, etc.). By controlling for these factors, the study infers adaptation effort and derives country efficiency rankings in disaster management, effectively quantifying the 'adaptation deficit' as the difference between expected and actual losses. Therefore, adaptation costs are not directly measured, but rather inferred from the reduced impact of disasters given certain levels of development and institutional quality.","The analysis primarily relies on ex-post observations, using panel data and econometric analysis of historical climate-related natural disasters and macroeconomic variables from 1980-2008 to infer adaptation efforts and efficiency.","This paper primarily focuses on empirically analyzing the ""adaptation deficit"" by examining the factors influencing disaster impacts (damages, deaths) and inferring adaptation effort through econometric analysis.

However, through its empirical analysis and econometric modeling, it indirectly suggests that countries exhibiting higher institutional quality and efficient disaster management (potentially improved by informational and institutional interventions) tend to experience fewer losses in terms of disaster deaths and economic damages. This implies that enhancing institutional capacity and information dissemination can improve a country's resilience to climate-related disasters, thereby reducing macroeconomic and macro-fiscal risks associated with such events.","This paper doesn't explicitly define ""sufficient adaptation levels"" or what it means to be ""well-adapted."" Instead, it focuses on measuring *relative* adaptation effort and efficiency across countries in disaster management. It infers adaptation effort by controlling for various factors (intensity, exposure, demand, and efficiency factors) in regressions of disaster damages or deaths. Essentially, a country is considered *relatively* well-adapted if, given its hazard exposure and socio-economic characteristics, it experiences lower disaster impacts (damages or deaths) than expected. Efficiency is quantified through an index derived from regression results predicting deaths per disaster, where a higher index indicates greater efficiency in reducing disaster deaths relative to other countries. The focus is on identifying adaptation deficits and ranking countries based on their relative performance, not on achieving some absolute standard of ""well-adaptedness.""",

Future impacts are projected using estimated coefficients and climate data under different RCPs, also assessing the impact of climate change on labor, fertilizer, and machinery. Adaptation is assessed by comparing short-run and long-run responses, using bootstrap procedures, and long difference estimations to account for farmers' adaptation.

Climate change poses asymmetric sovereign risk, particularly for emerging/low-income countries, affecting borrowing costs (sovereign spreads). Vulnerability to climate change increases spreads, especially for high-risk countries with short-term debt, while readiness to adapt can mitigate this. Spreads react more to climate change vulnerability and readiness (ND-GAIN index) as general concepts rather than specific natural disasters. Natural disasters themselves have mixed effects: economic losses increase spreads, while exposure/death tolls can decrease them. The impact of climate change vulnerability and readiness varies across the spread distribution (high-risk vs. low-risk countries) and debt maturities. Institutional quality (Rule of Law) is key in lowering borrowing costs. Traditional macroeconomic factors (debt-to-GDP, inflation) and external factors also significantly influence sovereign risk. Quantile regressions are essential to capture the varying impact of determinants across different segments of the spread distribution and are robust to outliers. A single time-varying factor can capture a significant portion of the variation in credit spreads globally.","The study examines asymmetric sovereign risk and its implications for climate change preparedness in Latin America and the Caribbean, highlighting the disproportionate effects on countries with higher spreads and short-term debt reliance. It distinguishes between emerging, low-income, and developed economies, incorporating factors such as international commonality, economic complexity, and natural disasters.

Climate policies, such as a rapid conversion to a low-carbon economy, can also introduce risks like economic recession and financial instability, potentially exceeding those from natural disasters. Changes in CO2 concentration significantly impact financial stability, exhibiting asymmetric long-run effects.","This material focuses on the relationship between climate change and financial stability, particularly in China. It explores the nonlinear and asymmetric impacts of climate change (specifically temperature changes and climate disasters) on financial stability, using methods like NARDL and impulse response functions. The analysis considers both short-term and long-term perspectives, drawing on the work of IPCC, NGFS, Nordhaus, Dietz & Stern, and others. The study distinguishes between physical and transition risks and references prior work on firm value, damage functions, and desertification, connecting these to broader macroeconomic and macro-fiscal risks.

Business-as-usual and adaptation scenarios.","The reviewed literature employs a range of methodologies to assess the macroeconomic and macro-fiscal risks of climate change and the costs/benefits of adaptation in the US. Two primary approaches are identified: econometric methods (using real-world data to correlate climate stressors with economic outcomes) and simulation approaches (modeling the impacts and adaptation pathways using tools like crop yield models and economic simulations). Specific methods include benefit-cost analysis, computable general equilibrium (CGE) modeling (e.g., RHG-MUSE), input-output models, scenario-based risk assessment, Ricardian analysis, multi-model comparisons, national-scale water resource modeling, and statistical analysis of historical data. Key models and projects mentioned are CIRA (Climate Impact Report and Assessment), the Risky Business Project (RiskLogic), GCAM-USA, ReEDS, and IPM. The analyses frequently incorporate discounted costs through 2100, compare business-as-usual and adaptation scenarios, and consider factors like carbon fertilization, water resource availability, and perfect foresight assumptions. Some studies also consider autonomous adaptation.","Climate change poses significant macroeconomic and macro-fiscal risks at the national level, particularly under high emissions scenarios (RCP 8.5), with potential economic losses reaching hundreds of billions of dollars annually by the end of the century (0.8-3.5% of GDP in direct costs). Key impacts include reduced crop yields, coastal damage from sea level rise and hurricanes ($18 billion for coral reefs alone), increased mortality, increased crime costs, infrastructure damage ($260 billion), and increased electricity demand. While adaptation can significantly reduce economic risks and even offer benefits, systematic information on adaptation costs and benefits is limited. Optimal adaptation strategies involve balancing costs and residual climate change impacts, recognizing technological, economic, and informational constraints. Investing in adaptation, particularly in capital replacement and maintenance, can yield substantial net gains. Mitigation policies also generate substantial benefits. Existing economic estimates of climate change impacts in the US are improving but still have gaps in sectoral coverage, climate stressors considered, and effect categories. US data richness supports sophisticated analysis of climate change impacts and adaptation choices. Macroeconomic modeling suggests that macroeconomic effects reduce the overall cost of direct climate impacts, but not fully inclusive of all costs. The US may be poorly adapted to current coastal risks.","The U.S. EPA’s CIRA program and the Risky Business project are key resources for national-scale estimates of climate change impacts, particularly focusing on quantifying economic risks. While these initiatives, along with others like the National Center for Atmospheric Research's BRACE program, highlight the importance of multi-sectoral analysis and general equilibrium estimates, the literature lacks standardized methodologies. Adaptation cost-benefit frameworks often draw from IPCC AR5 WGII. Estimating the value of intangible impacts (e.g., biodiversity loss, cultural heritage) is challenging, and impacts on less directly affected sectors are relatively understudied in the US. Adaptation in agriculture shows some promise but has unclear limits. Water resource integration for irrigation and the effects of climate change on ozone levels are inadequately addressed in US analyses. Sea level rise impact analyses are sensitive to ice sheet melting assumptions. Infrastructure analysis often lacks realistic learning and baseline maintenance considerations. Health impact estimates are highly uncertain. Mortality valuation varies depending on the chosen methodology. Intersectoral effects, particularly the water-energy nexus, are important omissions in some analyses. While much of the available literature is recent and relevant to the US, the geographic specificity of findings must be considered for a global review.

The DICE model damage function projects the impact of climate change on global economic production. Climate change impacts are modeled based on temperature, not precipitation, and the model lacks explicit sectoral analysis, especially concerning agriculture and energy/food price effects on poverty. The analysis tests the sensitivity of the IFs-RCP model results to changes in income inequality (Gini coefficient) and considers different poverty thresholds ($1.90, $3.20, $5.50) and time horizons (2030, 2050, 2070).

Projected global economic losses could range from $1.1–6.9 trillion by 2030 to $78.8–344.1 trillion by 2070. The severity of these impacts depends on climate and socioeconomic scenarios, with scenarios presenting high adaptation challenges resulting in lower long-term economic growth. Technology has a dual role, both contributing to and mitigating climate change. Reducing income inequality is crucial, and sustained efforts could potentially offset climate-attributable poverty increases; in some scenarios, a 5% improvement in global income equality by 2070 could eliminate climate-related poverty.

Key methodological aspects include: (1) construction of temperature shocks by detrending historical temperature data; (2) analysis of Generalized Impulse Response Functions (GIRFs) to assess output responses to monetary policy and temperature shocks; (3) Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) tests for stationarity; (4) nonlinearity tests, such as those by Hansen (1999) and Lo and Zivot (2001), to validate the TVAR approach; and (5) variations in model orderings and endogenous variables. The analysis focuses on the credit channel of monetary policy and often incorporates impulse response analysis to examine the effects of monetary and fiscal policy shocks. Some approaches also incorporate regression analysis of bank loan growth and non-performing loan ratios. The TVAR models are often applied to short-term (e.g., 20-quarter) analyses of policy effects under varying temperature conditions, with a focus on China, but also employing cross-country panel analysis.","Climate change, particularly through temperature shocks, weakens the effectiveness of monetary policy. High temperature regimes lead to credit constraints for commercial banks due to increased non-performing loan ratios stemming from weakened firm profitability and loan repayment ability. This weakens the bank credit channel of monetary policy transmission, making expansionary monetary policy less efficient and exacerbating the negative effects of contractionary policy on GDP. The influence of monetary policy on economic output is temperature-regime dependent, leading to larger economic fluctuations and prolonged divergence from steady states. Central banks should incorporate climate change into their monetary policy frameworks. Climate risks and natural disasters have significant impacts on economic production, financial stability, and firm investment.","This paper examines the impact of climate change, specifically temperature, on monetary policy effectiveness in China from 2004Q2 to 2021Q4.

Impacts vary significantly across crops, influenced by changing temperature and rainfall patterns, highlighting the need for targeted adaptation plans. Colombia's National Development Plan includes a framework for a National Adaptation Plan.","Synopsis: A study evaluating climate change impacts on Colombia's vulnerable agricultural sector, particularly smallholders, and proposing adaptation measures. It emphasizes a multidisciplinary approach, data collection, R&D, technology transfer, and agricultural insurance. The analysis, based on DANE (2007) and IDEAM (2001) data using the SRES-A2 emissions scenario and multiple GCMs, quantifies cropland affected by crop. It highlights the importance of governmental support, adaptation subsidies, regional climate modeling, and climate change impact assessment investments, acknowledging uncertainty in modeling inter-annual variability and extreme events. The study provides spatially distributed climate change predictions and variability across Colombia.",Adaptation,,,,,,,,,"Yes, the agriculture sector is specifically impacted.","Benefits of adaptation are quantified through numerical and qualitative assessments of adaptation options (e.g., varietal changes, changes in planting dates) in the agricultural sector, by projecting the impact of temperature and precipitation changes under specific climate change scenarios (SRES-A2) on different crops and calculating the percentage of cropland area affected. This involves using Global Circulation Models (GCMs) and regional climate models to understand climate change impacts on agricultural production.","Costs of adaptation are quantified through a combination of numerical and qualitative assessments of impacts and adaptation options on different sectors, such as agriculture. This involves analyzing climate model data, downscaling global circulation models to a finer resolution, and reviewing literature and statistical data. The impacts of changes in temperature and precipitation under different climate scenarios are projected to assess their effects on croplands. Adaptation options are tested, including changes in crop varieties and planting dates, and are evaluated through research and modeling to estimate the costs and benefits associated with these strategies.",The analysis relies on ex-ante modeling using Global Circulation Models (GCMs) and emission scenarios to project future impacts of climate change on Colombian agriculture.,"The adaptation planning/decision-making process discussed involves analyzing climate model data, downscaling it, and assessing the impacts of climate change (temperature and precipitation changes under the SRES-A2 scenario up to the 2050s) on Colombian agriculture. This includes understanding impacts on crops, proposing adaptation strategies (e.g., varietal changes, planting date adjustments), and testing these adaptation options through research and numerical/qualitative assessments. The analysis also involves identifying areas of cropland that will experience specific climate changes.","This paper does not address the benefits of ""soft options"" (e.g., informational and institutional interventions) as it focuses on modeling climate change impacts on Colombian agriculture and assessing adaptation strategies such as varietal changes and altered planting dates.","This paper doesn't explicitly define ""sufficient adaptation levels."" Instead, it focuses on analyzing the impacts of climate change on Colombian agriculture under a specific emissions scenario (SRES-A2) and assessing the potential of adaptation options like varietal changes and altered planting dates to mitigate these impacts. Therefore, adaptation success is implicitly measured by the degree to which these strategies can offset the negative impacts of climate change on crop yields and agricultural production.",

The analysis utilizes national livestock (specifically cattle stock) and cereal production data, weather data, and climate change predictions within a reduced-form framework. Methodological considerations include addressing omitted variable bias using group fixed effects, accounting for spatial (1000km) and serial (3-year) correlation in error terms, and testing robustness through various model specifications (e.g., excluding outliers or SSA). Long differences are used in addition to panel estimations to address adaptation, though without significant dampening of damage estimates.","Climate change is projected to significantly reduce animal output, particularly in hot, poor, and agriculture-dependent countries. Temperature increases have a robust negative effect on livestock and cereal yields, with a 1°C rise leading to a 9.7% reduction in beef production and a 7.6% drop in global cereal production. The impact is more pronounced in tropical regions, where adaptation is limited. Rainfall changes can positively influence production, partly offsetting temperature rises. These dynamics highlight severe risks to food security, especially in countries heavily reliant on agriculture. Despite some adaptive capacity considered, models predict significant damage to beef production due to warming.","This study presents middle-of-the-road estimates, neglecting adaptation and inter-seasonal weather changes, which often occur at smaller spatial scales than national. It identifies a nonlinear relationship between temperature and beef production, potentially mediated through the impact of temperature on crop production and, consequently, cattle feed availability. Limitations include the panel data method's inability to account for inter-annual farmer tradeoffs and its potential to capture short-run inventory changes instead of long-run climate change effects.

It employs linear and panel regression (with country-fixed effects) to assess the relationships between climate variables (PDSI, precipitation, VWC), El Niño events, and economic outcomes (agricultural GDP), including analysis of water savings induced by food trade.","Highlights: Regional food trade in Southern Africa, while water-efficient, depends on potentially unsustainable water resources in exporting countries. Trade, especially imports from outside the region, becomes crucial during droughts for redistributing water resources and mitigating food production gaps. Droughts significantly impact agricultural GDP in Angola and Namibia, and low rainfall influences green water consumption and agricultural GDP regionally. The 1991-1992 drought severely reduced maize yields. While trade openness helps during droughts, other droughts and inter-annual climate variability have less noticeable regional and national impacts, except in Namibia and Angola where climate significantly affects the agro-economy. Wetter years generally correlate with higher water productivity.","The study quantifies socio-economic and climate impacts on southern Africa's water-food-trade system, emphasizing trade's role in climate adaptation.

CO2-dependent carbon taxes are more effective than fixed taxes in mitigating climate risk, even though constant tax rates (e.g., 20-35%) can offer welfare gains and reduce disaster probability. Optimal tax policies involve revenue redistribution to ensure no generation experiences a loss in expected utility, prioritizing Pareto improvements that minimize disaster risk over uniform welfare gains. Increasing carbon taxes over time, especially in response to rising CO2 concentrations, further reduces disaster risks, though uncertainty in the damage function remains a crucial factor influencing outcomes. In the absence of climate-related risk, the need for policy interventions is minimal.","The model focuses on carbon risk as a driver of downside climate risk, exploring optimal carbon taxation in a multi-generational context. It features energy-usage shocks as a prerequisite for climate disasters, with climate sensitivity modeled as a random walk. A 'carbon-risk tax' is introduced, potentially exceeding the tax needed for average damage. The model includes dirty energy production, carbon taxation with revenue redistribution, and overlapping generations, with the distribution of assets condensed into a single state variable. The model simplifies by ignoring secular growth and acknowledging that the energy-usage shock formulation lacks micro-foundations. TFP-damages are used as a measure of economic damage. Higher carbon taxes could mitigate climate change but might require intergenerational compensation. The model acknowledges uncertainties in equilibrium climate sensitivity, using a simplistic climate model with a conservative calibration, suggesting that actual disasters are likely greater than predicted. Carbon taxes and redistribution end when the economy switches entirely to green energy. High carbon taxes at critical CO2 concentration levels might lead to consumption disasters. The authors argue their conservative parameter choices and stochastic approach provide lower bounds on possible damages and improved carbon taxes.",Macroeconomic/Fiscal,,Stylised changes,Adaptive,,Sequential Interactions,Adaptive (reflecting shifts in economic behavior in response to impacts),Tipping Points,"Models often involve optimizing carbon taxes or other policies. Some studies analyze the effects of different carbon tax policies under various shocks. Policy instruments include taxes on dirty energy and revenue redistribution among generations. Scenarios with and without carbon taxation are simulated. The analysis examines the distribution of TFP-damages, temperature changes, and aggregate consumption losses. Some models aim for Pareto-improvements and focus on maintaining current generations' utility.",,,,,,,,

Climate scenarios, often from the HadCM3 model, project conditions for 2020 and 2050, using 1960-1990 as a baseline. Crop modeling, specifically using APSIM and CERES-Wheat, is prominent for evaluating the effect of climate change on crop yields (soybean, wheat). Statistical analyses are used, including parametric methods, locally weighted regression (LOWESS) for rainfall, structural break analysis, Markov chains for dry/wet spells, and analysis of coefficient of variation (CV) to assess rainfall variability. Time series analysis involving ARIMA and SARIMA models is used for forecasting temperature, humidity, and precipitation. Remote sensing data is utilized to map apple orchards and terrain parameters. Hydrological modeling uses MIKE SHE coupled with remote sensing and GIS for water resource assessment. Panel data quantile regressions, log-linear regressions, and fixed effects models examine the impact of climate variables on agricultural productivity. Scenario analysis involves simulating uniform temperature increases and rainfall changes. The impacts of adaptation measures such as rubber dams are assessed through comparing crop yields before and after implementation. Water demand projections extend to 2050.","Climate change poses substantial macroeconomic and macro-fiscal risks, particularly through its impact on agriculture, which challenges food and nutritional security. Projected effects include a significant decrease in cereal productivity and enhanced crop water needs by 2050, particularly affecting rainfed areas. Temperature increases hasten crop maturity and reduce yields in major crops like wheat and soybean, with impacts varying across regions. Climatic shifts, such as altered rainfall and increased temperature variability, are observed in critical agricultural areas like Orissa, Uttar Pradesh, and the Northwest Himalayas, affecting crop production and increasing the incidence of extreme weather events. Rubber dams and agricultural diversification are effective adaptation strategies, enhancing productivity and farmer incomes, while weather insurance and public investment in research are vital for adaptation readiness. A need exists for sustainable water resource management in light of climate-induced changes, necessitating blending traditional knowledge with advanced technologies. Changes in temperature and rainfall patterns also affect geographic pest distribution, with ramifications on agricultural outputs, warranting further research and collaborative efforts for effective adaptation.","The material primarily focuses on climate change impacts on Indian agriculture, including regional and crop-specific vulnerabilities (rice, wheat, soybean, apples), water resource management, and potential adaptation strategies (crop diversification, adjusted sowing dates, drought-resistant cultivars, rubber dams, ICTs, wasteland development). Key themes include rainfall variability and declining trends (particularly in central and eastern India), increasing temperatures, changing crop water requirements, groundwater decline (especially in Rajasthan and hard rock regions of Maharashtra), and glacial retreat in the Himalayas impacting river flows. The research emphasizes the need for improved information access, community awareness, and agricultural diversification. While adaptation strategies are discussed, direct links to national-level macroeconomic or macro-fiscal risks, costs, and benefits are generally not explicitly explored, with a few exceptions, but it is mentioned how crop yields, including the impact of government initiatives and natural calamities, influence such outcomes. Developing countries like India are noted as more vulnerable due to fragile environments and lower coping capacity.",Adaptation,,,,,,,,,Agriculture is a sector clearly and specifically impacted.,"The benefits of adaptation are quantified using simulation models, such as the APSIM and DSSAT, to assess the impact of climate change on crop yields and explore adaptation options. Adaptation benefits are measured by comparing crop productivity and economic returns before and after implementing adaptation measures, such as changing sowing dates, plant density, or infrastructure like rubber dams. Quantitative methods include regression analyses, panel data approaches, and stochastic models (e.g., ARIMA) for forecasting climate variables and assessing their correlation with agricultural productivity.","The costs of adaptation are quantified using various modeling techniques, including simulation models like APSIM and CERES-Wheat for evaluating crop yield under climate scenarios (Pages 55-63), ARIMA models for forecasting climate variables (Pages 84-90), and water resource modeling like MIKE SHE for assessing groundwater fluctuations (Page 222). These methodologies simulate impacts of climate change on agricultural yields and water resources, allowing for the testing and optimization of adaptation strategies such as altering sowing dates, crop densities, or implementing infrastructure like rubber dams (Pages 106-110). The models are calibrated with historical data and validated to predict future scenarios, providing a basis for estimating adaptation costs relative to benefits across different scenarios and regions.","The analysis relies on both ex-ante modeling (climate scenarios, crop simulations, forecasting) and ex-post observations (historical rainfall analysis, structural break analysis, impact of rubber dams, panel data analysis of weather and agricultural outcomes).","The document discusses adaptation planning/decision-making primarily through the lens of agricultural adaptation to climate change. This includes: 1) the use of climate scenarios and crop models (APSIM, CERES-Wheat) to evaluate the impact of climate change on crop yields and to explore adaptation options like changing sowing dates and plant density; 2) analysis of historical rainfall data to understand trends, variability, and drought patterns; 3) forecasting temperature and precipitation using ARIMA/SARIMA models; 4) the implementation and impact assessment of specific adaptation measures like rubber dams; 5) analysis of farmer cropping patterns and information sources; and 6) econometric modeling of the impact of climate variables on crop productivity.

However, the research touches upon elements that *support* such interventions by establishing their need or providing tools for their effective design:

*   **Climate and Yield Modeling (Pages 55, 56, 58, 59, 61, 62, 63):** Crop models like APSIM and CERES-Wheat can assess the impacts of climate change on yields, informing farmers about potential risks and optimal adaptation strategies (e.g., sowing dates, plant density). This informs *informational interventions*.
*   **Rainfall and Climate Analysis (Pages 42, 44, 45, 50, 84, 86, 90, 112, 115, 117, 118, 119, 193, 194):** Statistical analysis and forecasting of rainfall patterns help understand climate variability and drought risk, enabling better preparedness and informing agricultural planning and water management. This informs both *informational and institutional interventions*.
*   **Remote Sensing (Page 95):** Remote sensing for mapping agricultural land helps monitor crop health and water resources, facilitating targeted interventions and resource allocation.
*   **Farmer Surveys (Page 129):** Understanding farmer cropping patterns and information sources is crucial for designing effective extension services and information dissemination strategies. This directly supports *informational interventions*.
*   **Water Resource Management (Pages 106, 108, 109, 110, 209, 222, 233):** Studies on rubber dams and water demand projections help inform water management policies and infrastructure development, supporting agricultural productivity and resilience. These can be *institutional interventions*.
*   **Impact Assessment (Pages 163, 164, 166, 171, 172, 173, 176, 183, 186, 187):** Studies examining the impact of climate variables on crop productivity are crucial for identifying vulnerable regions and developing targeted adaptation strategies.

Adaptation measures are explored (e.g., changing sowing dates, rubber dams), and their impacts are assessed through simulations or comparing outcomes before and after implementation, but no single, universally applicable threshold for ""sufficient adaptation"" is defined. The closest proxy would be analyzing crop yields/farmer returns before and after implementing certain adaptation strategies.",

A robustness test employs Two-Stage Least Squares (TSLS) estimation using lagged GDP as an instrumental variable. The analysis is extended to three regions to examine the mediating effect of air conditioning ownership. Estimated temperature-load response functions are then used to forecast peak load and required infrastructure investment to 2100 under different SSP-RCP climate scenarios from CMIP6 and Vuuren et al.

Projections include scenarios with and without socioeconomic variables.,"Peak electricity load in China is significantly impacted by temperature increases, particularly in Eastern China due to higher air conditioning ownership and economic development. While temperature increases contribute to higher peak loads, socioeconomic factors have a larger impact. Projections to 2100 show significant peak load increases, driven more by socioeconomic variables than climate change, with Eastern China maintaining the highest load. Models incorporating both climate and socioeconomic factors forecast significantly higher peak load growth, especially under SSP2-RCP4.5 and SSP5-RCP8.5 scenarios, and increased peak load from climate change will cause additional investment demand for electricity supply infrastructure.","The impact of maximum temperature on peak electricity load shows significant regional variation, with Eastern China experiencing the greatest effects, mainly due to the proliferation of air conditioners. While examining macroeconomic factors, endogeneity between GDP and power load is not significant. Regional differences influence how electricity loads respond to temperature changes. The projected costs for wind and solar power are derived from the China Electric Power Technology and Economy Development Research Report 2019, with an operational reserve capacity set at 15%. Policy recommendations emphasize integrating climate change considerations into long-term power planning, advancing energy-efficient air conditioning, and developing demand response programs, alongside leveraging electricity markets for investment and planning.

It also incorporates discount rates for future earnings to estimate the long-term economic impacts.,"The study utilizes a longitudinal birth cohort survey in the Philippines linked with weather and pollution data (CO and O3) to estimate the impact of early-life environmental exposures on human capital and labor market outcomes. The primary estimation method is Limited-Information-Maximum-Likelihood (LIML) with instrumental variables (weather extremes and seasonal deviations interacted with pollution source concentrations) to address omitted variable and measurement error biases. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regressions with extensive demographic and socioeconomic controls are used for robustness checks and short-term outcomes. Multiple hypothesis testing adjustments (Benjamini-Hochberg) are applied. Marginal Bootstrap Two-Stage Least Squares (MBTSLS) is also implemented with Sargan tests for comparison with LIML. The analysis calculates the discounted present value of long-term effects on earnings, assuming limited pollution avoidance behaviors and agent ignorance regarding exposure responses. External validity is assumed to scale ozone's effects on hours and earnings.","Early-life exposure to pollution, particularly ozone (O3), and extreme weather events (temperature and precipitation) significantly impact human capital development and long-term economic outcomes. Negative effects include reduced test scores, schooling, hours worked, and earnings, with disproportionate impacts on females and informal workers. Specifically, extreme weather during gestation affects birth weight and length, while early-life O3 exposure negatively impacts cognitive abilities and labor market performance. Reducing early-life O3 exposure could lead to significant increases in earnings and hours worked. These long-term human capital gains from improved early-life environments have the potential to fuel economic growth in developing nations, suggesting that the benefits of environmental regulations may outweigh their costs. While weather directly affects short-term anthropometric outcomes, long-term cognitive and labor market outcomes are primarily affected by pollution.","A study of Metro Cebu, Philippines, investigates the impact of climate on anthropometric measures, which are linked to labor productivity and long-term economic potential.

Technical names mentioned or implied for future scenarios in the paper include anthropogenic alteration scenarios and benchmark future scenarios for projecting climate impacts.","The methodological approach focuses on econometric analyses to evaluate the impact of climatic conditions on socio-economic outcomes, emphasizing innovations in linking different methods. Key themes include econometric challenges of summarizing high-dimensional climate data and choosing appropriate analysis intervals. The modeling of climate effects on outcomes incorporates both direct and belief-derived impacts. A regression framework is utilized to estimate climate's marginal effects, addressing omitted variable bias in cross-sectional and time-series contexts. Techniques such as the Baxter-King filter are employed to estimate climate impacts across various frequencies, particularly on agricultural yields. Differentiation approaches and the use of natural experiments help trace and understand climate change pathways. The aggregation of heterogeneous regional temperatures considers spatial covariance and regional exposure, with approaches like local linearizations and global nonlinear functions tackling displacement and delay effects. Distributed lag models account for the history of climate events, while spatial-temporal models estimate net effects across time and space, using spatial-HAC and block bootstrap to manage autocorrelation. Counterfactual analysis and simulations with historical and future scenarios guide empirical calibrations, integrating various econometric models and findings.","The review focuses on methodological issues in assessing climate change impacts, specifically the use of weather variables in regressions. Identifying belief effects is challenging due to observability and correlation issues. Core research trade-offs involve comparability of distinct populations and how well observed climate events capture direct and belief effects. Time-series temperature variations have consistent effects on maize yields regardless of timescale (below 33 years), but cross-sectional estimates are vulnerable to rainfall misspecification. Under certain conditions, the total effect of climate can be recovered using weather variation. Marginal effects of climate and weather on optimized outcomes are similar. Econometric models struggle to capture persistent drought and sea level rise due to measurement limitations. Nonlinear relationships can be recovered at finer scales even with broader outcome measurements. Larger, heterogeneous regions with longer observation periods can produce smoothed responses. Marginal effects of climate vary across locations due to average climatic conditions. Net and displacement effects of climatic events should be distinguished, including temporal displacement (harvesting) and delayed/spatial displacement. Methods can estimate outcome alterations from changes in historical climate. Recent methodological innovations have improved identification of climatic influences, and findings demonstrate replicability, enhancing credibility.","This material focuses primarily on methodological challenges in climate econometrics rather than providing specific macroeconomic or macro-fiscal results or cost-benefit analyses of adaptation at the national level. Key points include: differentiating weather from climate and acknowledging direct and indirect impacts of climate on social outcomes; addressing omitted variable bias in causal identification; testing marginal treatment comparability assumptions across temporal frequencies; the potential substitution of weather effects for climate change effects in optimized outcomes; challenges in measuring and modeling climate variables and disentangling complex pathways; the influence of spatial covariance on region-level model results; identifying assumptions in distributed lag models; the limitations of partial equilibrium estimates and the difficulty in verifying counterfactual outcomes; and the need for major methodological innovations to address challenges related to identifying mechanisms, measuring adaptation costs, general equilibrium effects, price responses, unprecedented events, and integration with theoretical models.",Macroeconomic/Fiscal,Econometric,,Adaptive,Regional,Spatial Interactions,Transitional (accounting for changes over time),,"Actions based on climate beliefs, b(C), are included in the model Y(C) = Y[c(C), b(C)].

Key aspects covered are: addressing high-dimensional climate data, choosing appropriate time intervals, modeling climate effects considering both direct weather impacts and belief-driven actions, and accounting for omitted variable bias. The analysis uses cross-sectional and time-series approaches, applying temporal filtering and band-pass filters across different frequencies. Differentiation is used to trace effects by observing optimized outcomes under varying weather distributions.

Approaches also include empirical calibration of process models and integrated assessment models.","The research tackles methodological debates surrounding the use of weather variables in regressions for climate change impact assessment, deriving conditions for their justification. Identifying belief effects alongside direct climate impacts is challenging due to observability and correlation. Core trade-offs involve comparability of populations and whether observed climate events sufficiently capture relevant effects. Weather variations can identify the effect of climate. The marginal effect of climate on optimized outcomes is similar to the marginal effect of weather. However, many climate dimensions (e.g., persistent drought, sea level) remain poorly captured. Nonlinear relationships can potentially be recovered at finer scales, even with broader outcome measures. Larger, heterogeneous regions and longer observation periods can smooth out responses to climate measures. Varying marginal effects across locations due to interactions with average climatic conditions are crucial, as is distinguishing net and displacement effects. Climatic events can cause temporal displacement or harvesting and generate delayed or spatial impacts, affecting future economic conditions. Replicability across contexts lends credibility to techniques and simulations and estimation of expected outcome changes due to historical climate shifts is possible.","Synopsis: The notes highlight methodological challenges in climate econometrics, emphasizing causal identification, omitted variable bias, and the construction of appropriate climate measures for econometric models. Weather affects social outcomes directly and indirectly through information. Marginal effects of weather can substitute for marginal climate changes in optimized outcomes. The validity of marginal treatment comparability assumptions can be tested by comparing climate effects across temporal frequencies. Local nonlinear effects are influenced by spatial covariance. Distributed lag models rely on the assumption that the influence of a climate event is determined by the time separating observations. Estimates should be viewed as partial equilibrium. Significant methodological innovations are needed to address identifying mechanisms, measuring adaptation costs, general equilibrium effects, unprecedented events, and integrating with policy models. The application of some model outputs must be approached cautiously due to the issue of counterfactuals.",Macroeconomic/Fiscal,Econometric,,Adaptive,Regional,Spatial Interactions,Transitional (accounting for changes over time),,Actions (b(C)) based on climate beliefs are modeled as influencing outcomes (Y(C)) alongside weather realizations (c(C)).

The MIRAGRODEP model is used to analyze different pathways to achieve goals, optimize instruments subject to constraints, and assess the impact of agricultural support policies on emissions and household welfare.

The 'true cost' of food production, including environmental and health externalities, vastly outweighs the cost of addressing hunger. Interventions such as producer and consumption subsidies, carbon taxes, and progressive tax systems are potential policy instruments, but coordinated responses involving multiple ministries are needed. Ending hunger and malnutrition by 2030 requires a combination of interventions, including safety nets, investments in R&D and extension services, and policies promoting diversified, nature-positive farming systems. Trade can mediate food surpluses and deficits, but requires a rules-based system. Key priorities include reducing food loss and waste, promoting sustainable livestock production, leveraging technology for climate change adaptation and mitigation, addressing gender disparities, and fostering international cooperation. Policy shifts are needed to treat agricultural lands as agroecosystems, prioritize pro-poor investments, and repurpose existing expenditures. Diversification and a focus on synergies are crucial for building resilience and maximizing the effectiveness of interventions, and the importance of integrating a biodiversity focus into agriculture policy, investments, and innovation.","This paper emphasizes the need for structural transformation of food systems, innovative financing (including green and social bonds and SDR allocations), and global coordination to achieve food and nutrition security in the face of climate change. Priorities include de-risking food systems (insurance, technology), ensuring food prices reflect real costs (including externalities), protecting land rights of vulnerable groups, addressing trade distortions, and diversifying food production. The MIRAGRODEP model is highlighted as a tool to investigate agrifood systems and assess interventions (social safety nets, school feeding, farm subsidies, technology, reducing food waste), acknowledging trade-offs regarding GHG emissions and land use. Key barriers to healthy diets include supply and demand issues, market access, and affordability. There are significant knowledge gaps related to rural out-migration and the impact of climate change on crop yields has been underestimated. Important research areas include the economic mitigation potential of dietary changes, quantifying externalities (undernutrition, zoonoses, soil degradation), and addressing imperfect competition in models. Biotechnology adoption, the human capital gap in LMICs' agricultural research, and the role of food system innovation hubs require attention. Increased investment in research, technologies, and incentives for environmental services is vital, along with addressing trade imbalances. International cooperation and a thorough monitoring system are crucial, as is policy alignment with dietary guidelines. Decentralized bioenergy systems offer cost reduction potential.

It compares different climate models within these ensembles to assess probabilistic outcomes. Simplified FAO/IFPRI-based methodologies are used to estimate irrigation water requirements globally for maize and wheat, considering soil, temperature, precipitation, PET, and crop-specific data. A signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is calculated, defining the signal as the trend from 1961-90 to 2040-2059 and the noise as the interannual standard deviation of the 2040-2059 period. Economic impacts are estimated based on yield changes, assuming costs to maintain historical yields in basins with decreasing yields and benefits in basins with increasing yields (where water is scarce), with adaptation costs based on either increased storage or a backstop cost of $1/m^3 of lost yield, whichever is less expensive. Basin-scale adaptation costs are aggregated to seven World Bank regions. The relationship between changes in precipitation/runoff and annual adaptation costs is analyzed using multiple climate model runs and fourth-order polynomial fits. Storage yield curves are utilized to understand climate change impacts on water resources. The analysis explores spatial and temporal patterns of confidence and uncertainty in projected river runoff, irrigation water requirements, and basin storage yield.","Climate models show agreement in the direction of change in water availability in some locations, offering clearer signals for long-term water infrastructure investments. Projections of water resource variables have higher agreement across ensembles than precipitation trends, informing climate adaptation measures. Climate change will have a more consistent increasing impact on crop water demand compared to runoff. The Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) aids in deciding when to implement flexible design strategies. The median global net cost of adapting to climate change in the 2050s is estimated at $15 billion annually. There's unexpected agreement across World Bank regions on the direction of economic outcomes, with general agreement on benefits in South Asia and costs in Latin America & the Caribbean; economic outcomes correlate to runoff trends. Different climate models project varying temperature changes, leading to a range of annualized costs, and model variability is important to consider. Relying on too few models can be misleading in regions with high uncertainty in projected changes. Agreement across GCM ensembles in broad regions increases confidence in water availability changes, but adaptation costs vary across within-model ensembles.","The material details key aspects of climate change's macroeconomic and macro-fiscal impacts related to water resources. It highlights the role of spatial and temporal averaging in water resource projections and calculates irrigation water requirements for maize and wheat via global climate model simulations, focusing on precipitation changes. Changes in precipitation and runoff drive economic and fiscal risks affecting agriculture, infrastructure, and other areas. Climate change impacts on water yield necessitate consideration of additional storage needs or alternative water sources, such as desalination. An analysis of fitted precipitation and runoff lines suggests costs are incurred even with zero precipitation changes, due to temperature effects. Cost estimates are global, incorporating internal variability and multiple model formalisms, with a discount rate of 5%. The material emphasizes the importance of considering both the mean and variability of projected runoff, showing magnified and systematically drier patterns in basin yields. The indicative analysis assumes static population and consumption rates, underscoring the need for further studies on global changes in food demand and population growth.",Adaptation,,,,,,,,,"Agriculture, specifically maize and wheat production requiring irrigation, is a sector significantly impacted.","The benefits of adaptation are quantified by estimating the economic gains in basins where climate change leads to increased yields, assuming water is a scarce resource. These gains are calculated based on the avoided losses from yield reductions.","Adaptation costs are quantified by estimating the cost of maintaining historical crop yields in basins projected to have decreasing yields due to climate change. This cost is determined by comparing the expense of either increasing water storage capacity or paying for a ""backstop"" of $1 per cubic meter of lost yield, choosing the less expensive option. The analysis uses large ensembles of climate model runs to project changes in runoff and precipitation, which are then related to adaptation costs using statistical models.","The analysis primarily relies on ex-ante modeling. It employs large-ensemble runs of climate projections and multiple climate models to estimate future climate change impacts and adaptation costs, as evidenced by the repeated references to model projections and evaluations for future periods up to 2050.","The adaptation planning and decision-making process discussed in the paper involves using large-ensemble runs of climate projections to evaluate probabilistic outcomes of climate change impacts on water resources. It incorporates simplified methods to assess irrigation needs and calculates economic effects by balancing costs and benefits in basins based on changing yields. The analysis further aggregates adaptation costs at a regional level, considers high-confidence spatial and temporal patterns, and uses model ensembles to project changes in water availability, linking these projections to adaptation costs. Different models and polynomial fits help in understanding the relationship between climate changes (runoff and precipitation) and the costs of adapting to these changes.",,"The paper seems to consider sufficient adaptation as the ability to maintain or improve economic and agricultural outputs in the face of climate change effects, specifically regarding water resources. Sufficient adaptation implies using models to project climate changes and evaluate their effects on water resources, thereby optimizing irrigation and water storage solutions to counteract decreasing yields or capitalize on increasing yields. Adaptation is measured economically by integrating costs and benefits linked to maintaining yields, adjusting storage, and managing water resource availability across regional scales. Therefore, 'well-adapted' could mean effectively managing these resources despite climate variabilities, as assessed through extensive climate model simulations, economic cost estimations, and adaptation strategies.","This paper does not address the benefits of ""soft options"" for climate change adaptation, focusing instead on the costs of ""hard"" infrastructure adaptations related to water resources and agricultural yields."

Historical climate records and a semi-parametric weather generator define future climate scenarios, providing daily weather simulations. A biased resampling algorithm downscales climate trajectories into synthetic weather series, considering variables like temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation. The study applies crop growth models, economic analyses, and uses prospect theory, including Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT), to evaluate decision-making processes, focusing on loss aversion and diminishing sensitivity. Crop simulations cover 24 cycles with 100 realizations each, integrating adaptive responses modeled through 'naïve,' 'clairvoyant,' and 'intermediate' farmer scenarios. Land allocation optimization employs a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based on crop/management conditions and economic profit, incorporating risk preferences from CPT. The study simulates farm economic returns under various climate scenarios and adaptation strategies, analyzing land allocation and adaptation effects.","Decreased precipitation in the Pampas region disproportionately impacts marginal agricultural areas like Pilar, leading to reduced crop profitability and increased economic risks. While the Pergamino region shows more resilience to decreased rainfall, adaptation, even if delayed, is crucial in Pilar to stabilize farm income and avoid economic failure. Adaptation strategies mitigate negative impacts of unfavorable climate scenarios, suggesting proactive measures are vital for maintaining agricultural sustainability in the face of changing rainfall patterns. Increased rainfall has driven agricultural expansion, particularly soybean production, raising sustainability concerns if drier conditions return.","The study examines the impacts of adaptation strategies on agricultural regions in the Argentinian Pampas, specifically focusing on Pergamino and Pilar.

This involves using crop models, weather generators, and optimization algorithms (like genetic algorithms) to determine optimal land allocations and expected profits, while also considering farmer risk preferences using Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT). The costs are then implicitly derived by comparing the economic outcomes of different adaptation pathways.","The analysis relies on ex-ante modeling, using historical climate records to generate future climate scenarios and crop models to simulate outcomes under those scenarios and various adaptation strategies.","The paper discusses adaptation planning/decision-making in the context of agricultural economics, specifically focusing on how farmers can adapt to decreasing precipitation.

Brazil's high solar irradiation and decreased generation costs owing to international market trends and lower interest rates make PV energy more economical than hydroelectric and biomass options. Economic benefits include self-sustained food production using PV energy and continuous income streams for small farmers, which may surpass government cash transfer support. Additionally, PV systems are poised to generate employment and offer a resilient, perennial income source for disadvantaged populations while increasing climate resilience through innovations like panel shading and rainwater collection.","Drought relief is often ineffective; solar energy solutions are suggested.

While hydropower is a cost-effective, low-emission technology with significant untapped potential (estimated 22.1 GW total), climate change and deployment constraints can hinder NDC targets and increase long-term power system costs. Inter-GCM uncertainty in climate models is significant. Constraining hydropower development increases reliance on natural gas, raising emissions and impacting energy security, while boosting hydropower is capital-intensive. Climate variability can both increase and decrease hydropower output (wet/dry scenarios). Biomass becomes important for decarbonization when hydropower is limited.

A case study using the TIMES-EC model highlights that constrained hydropower development, even with increased rainfall, can triple emissions compared to boosting hydropower. This is partly due to the model's limitations in capturing hydropower flexibility and the lack of consideration for temperature impacts on thermal plant cooling. Ecuador may need to import natural gas if hydropower is constrained and climate conditions are dry. The availability and cost of alternative technologies (solar, wind, biomass, natural gas with CCS) significantly impact the optimal energy mix and associated emissions.

Impact assessments of 1m sea-level rise consider socioeconomic conditions from the 1990s, as demonstrated for Senegal, Benin, and Nigeria.","Highlights: Regional cooperation facilitates climate change mitigation and adaptation. Small islands, deltaic regions (especially in Asia), and coastal ecosystems are highly vulnerable to sea-level rise, incurring significant economic costs for flood protection. Optimal protection strategies should prioritize densely populated, high-value areas. West Africa, particularly Nigeria, faces substantial land loss and displacement risks, exacerbated by population growth, leading to high adaptation costs relative to GNP. Bangladesh and Vietnam are at risk of mass displacement and potential declines in rice production without adaptation.","Impact assessments of climate change, particularly sea-level rise, are limited by data gaps, scenario development challenges, and methodological shortcomings, often focusing narrowly on direct effects and a 1m rise. Protection cost estimates, particularly for Benin, are likely underestimates due to outdated socioeconomic data and fail to account for rapid population growth. The Niger Delta is economically vulnerable due to oil infrastructure, and large-scale relocation may be necessary in Nigeria due to the impracticality of conventional sea defenses. Early studies may have underestimated the regional impact of sea-level rise on rice production.",Adaptation,,,,,,,,,"Coastal regions/sectors are specifically impacted by climate change, particularly through flooding and sea-level rise.","Benefits of adaptation are quantified through national assessments, often utilizing methodologies like the IPCC Common Methodology (CM). These assessments analyze vulnerability profiles and can be aggregated from local to regional and global scales. A key focus is on evaluating the avoided impacts and costs, such as reduced flood impacts, for different time periods and scenarios, often based on socioeconomic contexts at a national level.","Adaptation costs are quantified using methodologies like the IPCC Common Methodology (CM) and vulnerability profiles, often at a national level, and then aggregated for regional and global analysis. This involves evaluating specific climate change impacts (e.g., flood impacts from sea-level rise) and their associated costs based on socioeconomic conditions at specific time periods.","The analysis relies on both ex-post observations (e.g., flood impacts for 1990 and 2020 populations, assessment based on 1990s socioeconomic situations) and ex-ante modeling (e.g., assessment of impacts of a 1 m sea-level rise).","The document discusses the adaptation planning/decision-making process by highlighting the use of the IPCC Common Methodology (CM) for national assessments of vulnerability, comparative analysis of national studies to create vulnerability profiles, and regional analysis leveraging local and national assessments.

It includes scenario analysis comparing passive and active distributed PV generation, calculating potential revenue from PV energy generation considering taxes and ripple effects, and computing 'energy-density value'. A comparison is made between PV generation and traditional maize production based on output values per unit area.","Highlights: Northeast Brazil's abundant solar resource offers a novel adaptation strategy through distributed photovoltaic (PV) generation, particularly benefiting small farmers. PV energy complements hydroelectric power, especially during droughts, and has become economically competitive due to falling costs. PV systems can provide income exceeding government aid, support self-sufficient food production, and offer distributed employment. Rainwater harvesting from PV panels enhances resilience and meets water needs in semi-arid regions. Solar energy offers a perennial income source for historically excluded populations and increases resilience to climate change.","The material highlights the ineffectiveness of traditional drought relief in Brazil, advocating for solar energy solutions, particularly distributed PV micro power plants in degraded areas. Competition for water between irrigation and hydroelectric power negatively impacts farmers and food supply. While PV generation potential in degraded and desertified Northeast Brazil compares favorably to national hydroelectric output, normalized by 2017 consumption, associated numerical analysis requires caution due to simplified approximations.

A fixed-effects panel model, estimated separately for each region, uses temperature bins and interaction terms to capture non-linearities and asymmetric effects. The approach disentangles intensive- and extensive-margin adaptation components, modeling peak load response to temperature with a spline function modulated by short-run weather anomalies and long-run climate shifts. GCM-simulated climate scenarios (RCP 5-8.5) are used to project future peak load impacts, considering income variations and appliance adoption, with an emphasis on distinguishing between responses to climatic shifts versus weather anomalies and incorporating the amplification effect of per capita income.","Highlights: Climate change is projected to significantly increase peak electricity demand by 2050, particularly in Southern Europe and India, with interannual temperature variability amplifying these impacts. Increased air-cooling adoption is a key adaptation strategy, with long-run peak load responses being substantially larger than short-run responses. Impacts are heterogeneous, with a North-South gradient in Europe; northern countries may see reduced winter peaks, while southern countries will likely experience exacerbated summer peaks. India could see a 140% peak load increase and Europe a 19% increase by 2050, even without considering climate change, and per capita income modulates the effects of climate change on peak load. Climate change adaptation primarily involves changes in electricity demand along the extensive margin.","This study investigates the impact of climate and weather on electricity demand, differentiating between short-run (intensive) and long-run (extensive) responses, and considering the moderating role of income. It highlights the importance of accounting for economic structure, future income growth, and climate distributions in adaptation strategies, particularly concerning peak load management in power systems.

Social protection mechanisms, particularly vulnerability-targeted contingent social protection (VSP) and triage approaches, can mitigate these impacts and improve long-term poverty outcomes compared to standard cash transfers or no intervention (autarky). While short-term trade-offs may exist, VSP strategies demonstrate potential for long-term gains, even with budget constraints. Subsidized VSP programs offer promise in balancing competing demands within social protection systems. Insurance schemes, however, can sometimes yield higher poverty headcounts than doing nothing.","The analysis focuses on climate change's impact on poverty dynamics and the potential of social protection schemes (VSP) to mitigate these effects. Key aspects include a feedback loop where undernutrition diminishes future human and economic capital, exploration of social protection design under climate-related risk, and a vulnerability definition based on critical asset levels. The paper investigates asset smoothing and intergenerational asset shifting as coping strategies. A behavioral assumption is made that households do not account for long-term nutritional feedbacks on human capital.

*   **Decision-Making Under Uncertainty:** Traditional scientific approaches often fail when dealing with high levels of uncertainty. Decision-making should anticipate change and reduce vulnerability of policies and strategies to uncertain future developments.
*   **Robust Decision Making (RDM) and Dynamic Adaptive Planning (DAP):** RDM helps identify trade-offs, compares decision outcomes across multiple objectives, and focuses on layered and explicit decision-making processes. DAP manages risks by considering 'what if' scenarios, adapting over time, and maintaining flexibility through adaptation pathways.
*   **Adaptation Strategies:** Emphasis on robustness as a property of the ensemble of results. Adaptive strategies are crucial for long-term policy challenges and identifying vulnerabilities in current strategies. Implement adaptive strategies that are successful across a broad range of futures. DAPP makes path dependencies explicit to limit stranded assets and inflexible lock-ins.
*   **Policy Instruments and Approaches:** Combining carbon taxes and technology subsidies may be a promising robust strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Engineering Options Analysis (EOA) suggests modular, flexible strategies offer greater gains and lower risks. Decision analytic approaches separate decision understanding from future state probabilities. Flexible designs and capacity expansion when demand justifies perform best under uncertainty. The opportuneness strategy seeks windfalls at minimal uncertainty. IG theory is useful when models are expected to improve significantly in the near future.
*   **Robustness vs. Performance:** Robustness trades off against performance, requiring relaxation of performance requirements. Prioritize alternatives according to robustness for critical outcomes.
*   **Water Management:** RDM helps identify vulnerabilities in water management systems and develop adaptive strategies. Adaptive strategies can manage risk more effectively than static strategies but may not eliminate regret.
*   **International Decarbonization:** No single policy is robust across all futures, but independent carbon taxation is a necessary first step.
*   **Flood Management:** DAPP is used to manage flood risk.
*   **DMDU (Decision Making Under Deep Uncertainty) Approaches:** DMDU approaches improve policy analysis by acknowledging deep uncertainties, providing a common vocabulary, and enabling adaptive processes. DMDU helps to improve the adaptivity and robustness of policies, creating a shared strategic vision. DMDU approaches can profit from feedback from researchers and practitioners. DMDU applications offer a body of theory and practice with the potential for providing a common vocabulary to the work of both analysts and of those charged with policy design and implementation during uncertain times.
*   **Key Factors for Success:** Leadership, political backing, and stakeholder engagement are crucial for the adoption of adaptive planning.
*   **Delta Management:** Adaptive Delta Management (ADM) can reduce chances of over- and underinvesting and adaptation pathways are seen as important outcomes.
*   **Stress Testing:** Climate stress tests incorporate correlated behavior of multiple variables and reveal system sensitivities.","The material under review focuses on decision-making under conditions of deep uncertainty, particularly in the context of climate change adaptation and risks.

Instead, it focuses on methodologies (like RDM, DAPP, EOA, and IG) to make robust decisions under deep uncertainty, emphasizing flexibility and adaptation over time. ""Well-adapted"" in this context means having strategies that perform acceptably across a wide range of plausible futures, minimize regret, and allow for adjustments based on monitoring and pre-defined triggers. It is about identifying vulnerabilities, building resilience, and creating pathways that can be adapted as the future unfolds, rather than achieving a static, optimal endpoint. Performance is often evaluated against objectives, such as water supply reliability or cost thresholds, with a focus on minimizing deviations from desired levels across scenarios.","Soft options, within the DMDU framework, contribute to building resilience and adaptability by facilitating monitoring, learning, and adjustments of climate change strategies over time, enabling effective risk management without relying on precise predictions and allowing for flexible responses to unfolding future conditions."

It normalizes physical risk metrics to 2050 values under a 2°C scenario and uses a reference period of 1981-2010 for physical climate impacts. The framework downscales outputs from IAMs to assess financial risks at firm and household levels, considering multiple 2°C pathways and comparing physical and transition risks, especially around mid-century. The analysis includes scenario data analysis and visualization, financial risk analysis, and literature review. Transition risk indicators are used to assess carbon leakage, mitigation feasibility, and stranded assets under 1.5°C and 2°C scenarios. Land-use change emissions are considered in relation to fossil fuel emissions prices. Spatially-explicit global-scale impact models are used to calculate hazard indicators based on damage functions constructed from CMIP5 climate models. Observed climate time series (1981-2010) with pattern-scaling are used to simulate river flows (Mac-PDM.09) and define drought (SRI), with specific indicators for agricultural drought (SPEI) and maize crop impacts.","Climate change risks are highly dependent on temperature pathways. Physical risks are most sensitive to temperature by 2050, while transition risks are more sensitive by 2030 and depend on technology, policy, and socio-economic factors for 2°C targets. A ""No Policy"" scenario projects a 4.3°C rise by 2100, compared to 3.1°C under current NDC pledges and a peak of 1.7°C around 2050, returning to below 1.5°C by 2080 in a 1.5°C scenario. Major heatwaves and agricultural impacts show non-linear relationships with temperature; India is particularly vulnerable to river flooding and agricultural drought. The 1.5°C scenario results in higher global abatement costs. Transition risk-temperature pathway relationships vary by region and model. Near-term transition risks are significant for specific business sectors, increasing with mitigation stringency, and similar long-term physical risks can have vastly different near-term transition risks. Emissions intensity at the sectoral level is a key metric for benchmarking company performance. Drought, more so than temperature, can significantly impact maize yields, especially in water-limited regions. Risk assessments should account for uncertainty and extreme values, as single-model analysis provides limited context.","Synopsis: The analysis uses scenario-based modelling, focusing on energy-economic pathways and financial implications, primarily exploring global and regional climate risks relative to a 2C Central scenario. It examines transition risks, rather than physical climate risks, and doesn't account for adaptation measures, potential growth stimulus from low-carbon investment, or land use changes.

This includes estimating elasticities of energy demand with respect to temperature, considering non-linearities and aggregating meteorological data consistently. The analysis disentangles short- and long-run responses, incorporating population and GDP growth scenarios. The approach models heterogeneity across sectors, fuels, and regions, stratifying by climate zones (Temperate, Tropical, Dev.Min countries) and distances from the equator. It also uses different capital proxies (per capita GDP, aggregate capital stocks, and accumulated real imports) to estimate the marginal effect of temperature. Projections of future energy consumption are made by intersecting empirical results with climate model (e.g., CMCC-CM) and socioeconomic (e.g., SSP5) projections, comparing scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), and conducting sensitivity analysis on parameter estimates, particularly around 2050, considering adaptation mechanisms. Different econometric approaches (static, first-difference, dynamic) are compared, sometimes including interaction terms and prices.","Climate change impacts energy demand unevenly across the globe, with regressive effects disproportionately affecting low- and middle-income countries. Energy demand exhibits a V-shaped response to temperature, differing between tropical and temperate zones. The study models energy demand as a function of temperature and humidity, emphasizing intensive and extensive margin adjustments. Most areas will experience more hot days and fewer cold days, impacting heating and cooling needs. By 2050, the fuel mix is projected to shift toward electricity.

Developing countries, particularly in the tropics, will see significant energy consumption increases, with the greatest heat exposure increases in already hot regions with low energy use. Regional variations in projected energy demand are significant, with increases in Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia, and mixed responses (often with residential sector decreases) in Europe, North America, and Oceania. Global energy consumption increases are largely driven by tropical countries.

Under RCP 8.5, total world energy demand increases significantly by 2050, while changes are smaller under RCP 4.5. Uncertainty in temperature and GDP responses leads to a wide range of possible outcomes. Asymmetric energy consumption responses are observed, with hot days increasing electricity consumption more in residential sectors in temperate regions and commercial sectors in the tropics. Temperature and humidity significantly affect GDP per capita, varying by sector and region; low temperatures have a significant impact on GDP per capita in certain models.

The study identifies key elements missing in the impact literature: heterogeneity in demand response across sectors, fuels, and regions, and interaction of these responses with temperature data. Climate change leads to a geographic and seasonal redistribution of energy consumption towards tropical regions and summer months due to higher electricity use for cooling. Increases in temperature days lead to adaptation impacts, such as increased long-run effects on energy consumption in temperate countries.","The paper models the impact of climate change on global energy demand, scaling grid-cell level data to national levels. It analyzes final demand for electricity, fuel oil, and natural gas across residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural sectors, using first differences for temperature, humidity (specifically humidity), and other variables. A fixed effect captures country-specific factors. The model distinguishes between short-run and long-run effects, with long-run demand response calculated as the cumulative disequilibrium demand. The analysis focuses on the elasticity of GDP with respect to temperature-induced changes in energy demand, differentiating between temperate and tropical regions. While primarily focused on energy demand and its drivers, some results on the impact of temperature and fuel oil use on GDP are presented, although these results are characterized by low R-squared values and sensitivity to model specification. Findings suggest climate change impacts are secondary compared to economic expansion on global energy demand, but acknowledges a 'long upper tail of impacts' due to uncertainties in energy consumption responses. The impacts are considered a lower bound in temperate countries due to adaptation. The methodology accounts for geographic variations, sectoral, and fuel heterogeneity. Limitations include reliance on a uniform distribution of per capita energy demand at the grid-cell level, using only one ESM and socioeconomic scenario, and not explicitly linking energy consumption changes to end-use services.

It employs a multi-peril approach, combining CCR's hazard and damage models with climate projections from Météo-France's ARPEGE-Climate model up to 2100 under various RCPs. The flood model consists of surface run-off and river overflow components supplemented by coastal flooding assessments using TELEMAC-2D, TOMAWAC, and LISFLOOD-FP-like models. Flood hazards are quantified for 72-hour and 10-day rainfall using 10-year return period thresholds, with coastal flood events defined by tide, pressure, and wind speed data. Vulnerability projections consider the number of insured properties at the commune level based on INSEE forecasts as well as variations in insured values from CCR's historical insurance database, extrapolated to 2050. Probabilistic hazards are analyzed using event sets for flood return periods, and potential financial losses are visualized with box plots under varying scenarios. The results, focused on France, estimate losses for a 50-year return period and apply this to an infra-communal scale for continental and coastal flood simulation under the RCP 4.5 scenario.","Projected increases in insured losses by 2050 are driven by climate change, population growth, and insured value growth. Simulations estimate a potential billion-euro loss from continental flooding and 100 million from coastal flooding from a single event. Insured properties are projected to increase by 11.7%. Regional disparities exist in insured value growth, with climate change extending flood-prone areas; a 20cm sea level rise significantly expands flooded areas. Mean annual insurance losses from flooding, storm surge, and multi-hazard events are expected to increase, particularly in vulnerable locations like Carnac, Beuamer and Légendes. Total annual damages from flood and storm surge are projected to rise from €855M to €1325M (+55%) by 2050, with approximately 20% attributable to climate change.","A model simulating flood, storm surge, and drought using hourly rainfall, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, and Soil Wetness Index is calibrated and validated against a database from 2003.

The focus is on empirical analyses using historical climate and economic data, utilizing variables like dry spells, heat waves, drought measures (SPEI), and aridity indices derived from observed data.","The analysis utilizes a global panel dataset of daily precipitation and temperature (1979-2016) from the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) gridded to 0.5-degree latitude to investigate the impact of dry spells (varying durations) and heat waves on crop production and FAO CPI growth at a national level. The core methodology involves linear regression models with country and year fixed effects, adjusting for covariates like temperature, precipitation, and quadratic time trends. Various model specifications are employed to assess robustness, including distributed lag models, cubic/quartic terms for temperature/precipitation, temporal weighting of dry spells and heat waves using cropped area, and inclusion of lagged agricultural output. Drought is measured using the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), and aridity is based on the FAO's aridity index. Spatial weighting is used to construct national-scale variables. Techniques used to address potential endogeneity and mediation include sequential g-estimation (to account for the influence of dry spells on drought) and panel bootstrapping for inference. The analysis also explores heterogeneous effects based on aridity, drought, and irrigation through split-sample and interaction term regressions. Standard errors are typically clustered at the country level.","Dry spells, particularly those lasting 4-5 weeks or longer, negatively impact crop production growth and the FAO CPI, primarily through direct, but transitory, effects. These impacts are exacerbated by drought, aridity, and occur in regions with water deficits and limited irrigation. Heat waves can interact with dry spells, sometimes mitigating negative effects in specific scenarios (e.g., very long heat waves). Irrigation may lessen the negative impacts of dry spells on cereal yields, although this is not always statistically significant. While dry spells negatively affect agricultural value added per capita, there appears to be no long-term effect on overall GDP growth. The severity of the impact is contingent on the duration of both dry spells and heat waves.","The study investigates the impact of punctuated weather events and multiple stressors on agricultural outcomes, with a focus on aggregate crop production as measured by the FAO Crop Production Index. High spatial resolution data (5-10 arc-minutes) is used, aggregated to the national level, and evaluates the effects of dry spells, irrigation, and heat waves on crop performance. The paper considers whether irrigation can mitigate negative impacts, using g-estimation to address potential confounding by drought acting as a mediator. Key findings include that high temperatures and lengthy dry spells exacerbate stress on crops, although the evidence for a compounding effect of these factors is weak. Thresholds for aridity, drought, and irrigation define varying intensity scenarios, with particular focus on dry spells lasting 28+ days and heat waves of 9+ days. Statistical models explore country and time fixed effects, interactive effects, and distributed lag models.

This increased electricity demand primarily impacts PM2.5 and O3 levels, leading to premature mortalities and associated economic costs, particularly in the eastern US. While newer, more efficient energy sources partially offset the emissions increases, adaptation via air conditioning still contributes to the overall health burden of air pollution (5-8%). Adaptation measures can lead to both increases and decreases in air pollution concentrations, varying by region and pollutant. The health impacts of increased building energy use due to climate adaptation include an 8.7% increase in deaths compared to climate change impacts alone.","Synopsis: The study investigates air quality-related health impacts in the eastern US, focusing on the month of July, driven by increased electricity demand from a 3.5°C warmer summer. It models the interactions between climate, energy production, and air quality by maintaining the existing power plant inventory. Key limitations include the short time horizon (single month and year), regional focus, and inability to directly compare results to NAAQS or sum PM2.5 and O3 health impacts due to interaction effects. While exploring the potential damages from climate change, it does not project future conditions. It highlights potential for both negative and positive localized air quality changes (specifically noting a small decrease in concentrations in the southeast), and underscores the need for cleaner energy sources, efficiency measures, and demand-side management to mitigate adverse health effects. End-of-pipe technological controls may reduce pollution but increase energy use. The reported costs are likely underestimates of broader macro-fiscal impacts, focusing on PM2.5-related mortality.",Adaptation,,,,,,,,,"The power sector is specifically impacted due to increased electricity demand for air conditioning as an adaptation response to climate change, which affects emissions, air quality, and ultimately, public health and associated economic costs.","Benefits of adaptation are quantified by modeling the reduction in air-pollution-related health damages, particularly mortality, achieved through adaptation measures (e.g., increased air conditioning). This involves using climate and air quality models (WRF, CMAQ, etc.) to simulate air pollution concentrations with and without adaptation, then applying concentration-response functions (from BenMAP and other expert sources) to estimate changes in mortality and morbidity. The economic value of these health improvements is estimated using metrics like the value of statistical life (VSL). The difference in health outcomes (and associated costs) between scenarios with and without adaptation represents the quantified benefit.","The costs of adaptation, in this specific study, are quantified by modeling the increased air-pollution-related health damages caused by increased air conditioning use in a warmer climate. This involves using computer models to estimate air pollution and health impacts with and without increased air conditioning, and concentration-response functions to estimate mortality increases. The cost of deaths is estimated using the value of statistical life (VSL) based on existing literature. The EPA’s BenMAP tool is used to calculate the incidence of adverse health outcomes given changes in air quality, relying on expert-derived exposure–response functions.

It analyzes basin performance under historical and projected climate conditions (A2 and A1B emissions scenarios), using downscaled WCRP CMIP3 climate data from Maurer & Hidalgo (2008). The analysis projects flow and runoff changes applicable to 2050 (flow) and 2040-2069 (runoff), and examines sensitivity to water value assumptions. It compares water flow and power generation under different climate models (GCMs) and dam management scenarios in the Ganges basin, focusing on the year 2050. Climate models project changes in water availability and hydropower production, with optimization models allowing for groundwater use during shortages. The analysis assesses water availability using SWAT, models monthly flows (including high flow events), and economically values energy and irrigation benefits under various climate and infrastructure scenarios. Economic valuation is conducted under different dam scenarios using GCM projections for the A2 emissions scenario for 2050, based on temperature, rainfall, and runoff estimates from 16 GCMs. The framework developed can estimate climate damages through changes in water resources across a range of scenarios.","Hydropower and irrigation infrastructure development in the Ganges basin offer significant economic benefits (US$4-8 billion/yr), but are vulnerable to climate change, particularly drier conditions, and exhibit considerable uncertainty related to precipitation projections across different climate models. Climate change impacts on water flow are predicted to be greater than the impact of the infrastructure itself. Optimal water allocation is sensitive to the relative values of irrigation and low flow augmentation, with little tradeoff between hydropower and downstream water use. Given the uncertainty and potential for both increases and decreases in hydropower production and irrigation availability, emphasis should be placed on flexible, robust, and adaptive water management strategies that perform well under a range of climate scenarios and deliver immediate benefits.","The hydrological impacts of climate change in Bangladesh, particularly related to water resources and power generation, are discussed. GCMs' accuracy in simulating monsoon precipitation in South Asia is questionable, potentially overestimating water scarcity due to neglecting potential adaptation. The western movement of the river system is protecting the western coast of Bangladesh. Smaller dams are more effective for irrigation than mega dams in some regions. Managing current hydrological variability is crucial for adapting to future climate change in the Ganges.

The methodology also includes hazard risk assessment and sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the financing mechanism.",,"The paper doesn't directly define ""sufficient adaptation levels."" Instead, it focuses on optimizing adaptation interventions based on forecast probabilities and cost-benefit analyses. It implicitly suggests that ""well-adapted"" means having a forecast-based financing mechanism that triggers action when the expected benefits of acting (given the disaster probability and potential losses) outweigh the costs, adjusted for risk perception. The goal is to identify probability thresholds for action that maximize overall welfare, not to define a fixed state of being ""well-adapted.""","Soft options, such as forecast-based financing (FbF) models, offer the benefit of enabling proactive action based on probabilistic warnings, potentially reducing disaster losses. By investing based on forecasts, even before a disaster strikes, early action can be triggered, proving more cost-effective than reactive responses. The methodology considers the costs and benefits of acting or not acting based on probability thresholds, and is updated based on experience from false alarms or successful interventions."

Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) are essential for simulating global economic and biophysical processes, capturing the sequence from economic activity to socio-economic consequences of climate change. These models help examine trade-offs between adaptation costs, mitigation expenses, and residual damages, and facilitate analysis of adaptation-mitigation strategies under different discount rates and climate uncertainties. System-wide models, including computable general equilibrium, macroeconomic models, and input/output analysis, offer insights into economy-wide and combined adaptation impacts. General equilibrium models specifically focus on long-term impacts via static equilibrium comparisons. Decision-making tools such as Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA), Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA), Multi-criteria Analysis (MCA), and various risk management and decision-support frameworks are applied in adaptation economics. Evaluation methods address different policy scenarios and adaptation pathways, comparing net present values (NPV) of adaptation investments over time. Diagrams of supply and demand shifts further illustrate economic impacts of adaptation and climate protection.","Adaptation is crucial for reducing climate risks and requires proactive policy intervention, knowledge, planning, and coordination. Economy-wide models for adaptation are rare, and knowledge gaps remain, particularly regarding indirect effects and short-term shock costs. Early adaptation is beneficial when early benefits are significant and when it reduces later costs. Adaptation is intertwined with broader economic decisions and affects macroeconomic aggregates. The type of development impacts resilience, though the net effect is ambiguous. While policymakers see adaptation and mitigation as complements, they are more likely substitutes in economic terms, and an effective response requires both. Determining the optimal mix is difficult due to limited agreement on their relative effectiveness. Research is needed on adaptation strategies for higher warming levels and switching adaptation regimes.","Input-output tables may require adjustments to project climate change effects, particularly concerning indirect risks and adaptation needs that could outweigh direct impacts in certain sectors. A lack of empirical evidence exists regarding adaptation strategies for extreme climate change scenarios.

The timing of adaptation investments (early vs. later) and policy evaluation under different climate scenarios are also considered.",,"Different papers understand sufficient adaptation levels as the point where the costs and benefits of adaptation measures are balanced, accounting for the trade-offs between adaptation, mitigation costs, and residual damages. This understanding involves using various models, such as integrated assessment models, computable general equilibrium models, and cost-benefit analysis, to evaluate impacts and economic outcomes over time. Sufficient adaptation implies being proactive and reactive to climatic uncertainties, ensuring the economic impacts of climate changes are minimized through policy evaluation and decision-making tools that consider multiple factors like discount rates and adaptation pathways.","Soft options, such as informational and institutional interventions, offer significant benefits in the context of climate change adaptation. They facilitate informed decision-making, enhance adaptive capacity, and foster coordination and cooperation among stakeholders. These interventions can help lower adaptation costs by improving efficiency and targeting of hard adaptation measures. They also aid in managing uncertainty and promote flexible, iterative approaches to adaptation, ensuring that strategies remain effective under varying future conditions.

Analyses focus on seasonal average temperatures and temperature bins, considering contemporaneous and lagged weather effects, with standard errors clustered by firms and prefecture-level city-years.

Differential seasonal effects exist, with summer and winter temperatures generally negatively impacting output, while spring and fall temperatures can have positive effects. Future warming is projected to reduce China's industrial output, with variations depending on the climate model and scenario, and the impact is expected to be larger in the long term. Temperature's effects vary across industries, impacting investment and inventory, and influencing production in subsequent years.","Firm-level data from China (1998-2007) is used to analyze temperature effects on output across industries, accounting for simultaneous weather variations, lags, autocorrelation, and spatial correlation using data from 820 weather stations.

The analysis uses species-specific parameters and a Pella-Tomlinson yield curve to calculate MSY and MCP, with revenue calculated assuming constant prices and costs (with sensitivity analyses performed). Spatial distribution modeling is employed to compare present-day (2000-2019) and future periods (2041-2060, 2081-2100), and the analysis examines changes in fishing effort and profit potential across different SSP scenarios and fishing grounds. Machine learning models are used with scenario-based projections to forecast fisheries availability, with acknowledged uncertainties.","Climate change is causing a redistribution of fishery resources, leading to biological and economic trade-offs. This includes potential declines and collapses of valuable species, impacting livelihoods and revenue. While some regions may see increases in Maximum Catch Potential (MCP), these don't necessarily translate to increased Marginal Revenue Product (MRP) or Marginal Physical Product (MPP), as lower-value species may dominate. High emission scenarios exacerbate negative economic impacts, potentially leading to loss of high-value taxa. Even well-managed ecosystems may face challenges in the long-term, requiring forward-looking and climate-smart solutions to maintain food security and sustain fisheries-reliant sectors. Governance challenges and overexploitation risks also increase with fish stock movement. Sensitivity analysis suggests that the main economic findings are robust to different assumptions on prices and costs over time.","The study examines the economic impacts of climate-driven redistribution of fishery resources in the Eastern Bering Sea and Chukchi Sea (US territorial waters), focusing on groundfish and snow crab. Under a high-emissions scenario (SSP585), maintaining current fishing patterns from Dutch Harbor could lead to declining catches of valuable species like Pacific cod and snow crab. Increased transit times due to shifting fishing grounds and the resulting trade-offs are considered. The analysis assumes constant prices and costs, representing a simplification, and acknowledges structural uncertainties stemming from Earth System Models. Changes in Minimum Cost Paths (MCP) are positively correlated with the severity of the climate scenario, while reductions and shifts in low-catch and high-economic value species impact marginal resource and production prices (MRP and MPP).",Adaptation,,,,,,,,,The fisheries sector is specifically impacted.,"Benefits of adaptation, in the context of fisheries, are quantified using bioeconomic modeling to assess changes in maximum catch potential (MCP), maximum revenue potential (MRP), and maximum profit potential (MPP) under different climate scenarios (SSPs). This involves calculating MSY (Maximum Sustainable Yield), projecting species biomass, and estimating revenue based on catch and prices, then comparing future values to present-day levels. Sensitivity analyses also explore the influence of changing prices and costs.","The paper quantifies adaptation costs in the fisheries sector through bioeconomic modeling. It projects changes in maximum catch potential (MCP), maximum revenue potential (MRP), and maximum profit potential (MPP) relative to present-day levels under different climate scenarios (SSPs). This involves calculating MSY using species-specific parameters, computing MCP using model-derived biomass and reference exploitation rates, and estimating revenue assuming constant prices and costs (with sensitivity analyses exploring price and cost changes). The analysis compares present-day (2000-2019) and future periods (2021-2100) with 20-year intervals.","The analysis relies on ex-ante modeling using future climate scenarios and projections based on CMIP6 models and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) to simulate future fisheries abundance, catch, revenue, and profit potential.","The paper focuses on modeling the biological and economic impacts of climate change on fisheries, using bioeconomic models to project changes in species abundance, maximum catch potential (MCP), revenue, and profit under different climate scenarios (SSPs). It explores spatial distribution of fish stocks and fishing effort, and examines the sensitivity of economic results to changes in prices and costs.

Instead, it implicitly assesses adaptation by analyzing projected changes in maximum catch potential (MCP), maximum revenue potential (MRP), and maximum profit potential (MPP) relative to the present-day (2000-2019) under different climate change scenarios (SSPs). A smaller decline or an increase in these metrics under future climate conditions, achieved through shifts in fishing effort or management strategies (though not explicitly modeled here), could be interpreted as a sign of successful, albeit unquantified, adaptation.

It focuses on a general model of coastal real estate markets and sea-level rise.,"Coastal property values, demographic transitions, subsidies, sea level rise (SLR), coastal property markets, price declines, real estate markets, resident incomes, shoreline management, property value decline, oceanfront, non-oceanfront, beach width, investor housing share, expected return, marginal income tax rate, risk premium, storm risk.","Sea Level Rise (SLR), Storms, Coastal Erosion, Beach Nourishment, Real Estate Markets, Investor Behavior.",Baseline scenario with SLR beginning at year 50; Scenario with agents restricted from arbitrage; Scenario with a 50% reduction in the subsidy rate at the onset of SLR.,"The methodology employs a coupled human-natural systems agent-based model (Coastal Home Ownership Model or C-HOM) to simulate the long-term evolution of coastal real estate markets, resident incomes, and shoreline management decisions in response to sea level rise (SLR) over a 150-year horizon. The model simulates oceanfront and non-oceanfront properties and includes owner agents, investor agents, and community-level beach management. Numerical experiments involve comparing baseline scenarios to scenarios with altered subsidy rates, and analysis considers cases with and without agent mobility to exploit arbitrage opportunities. The model's spatial resolution is intermediate between a town and a census block group.","Highlights: Coastal property value responses to sea-level rise (SLR) are complex and influenced by policy interventions, demographic shifts, and market dynamics. Subsidies (e.g., coastal management, beach nourishment) and tax advantages can temporarily dampen or delay property value declines due to SLR, but these effects are often transitory. Restrictions on high-income agents entering the market can accelerate property value declines. Reducing nourishment subsidies increases property value volatility and can lead to a precipitous decline in property values, particularly for oceanfront properties, while increasing the median owner income tax rate. The trade-off between demographic transitions and property market adjustments to climate change risks is explored. The research models the effects of climate change on coastal housing markets and considers beach nourishment as an adaptation strategy.","The model incorporates sea-level rise (SLR) impacts on property values, considering risk premiums, investment, and income, and the effects of state and federal subsidies (including beach nourishment). Subsidies can lead to stable beach conditions, attracting higher-income residents, potentially causing coastal gentrification, particularly due to persistent natural amenities. Removing subsidies, while reflecting SLR risks, could also trigger gentrification. The model features a fixed housing supply and considers how agent flux introduces higher-income agents capitalizing on arbitrage opportunities.",Adaptation,,,,,,,,,"Yes, the real estate sector, specifically coastal real estate markets, is directly impacted.","The benefits of adaptation are quantified through model simulations that compare different scenarios, such as a baseline scenario without adaptation measures (like reduced subsidies) to scenarios where adaptation measures are implemented. The difference in outcomes, such as property values and income, between these scenarios represent the benefits of adaptation. The Coastal Home Ownership Model (C-HOM), an agent-based model, is used to simulate these scenarios, focusing on the effects of sea-level rise on coastal real estate markets and incorporating factors like homeowner behavior and shoreline management decisions.","The costs of adaptation are quantified through simulations of a coastal real estate market using the Coastal Home Ownership Model (C-HOM). This agent-based model simulates interactions between real estate markets, resident incomes, shoreline management decisions, and sea-level rise (SLR) over a long time horizon. The model is used to analyze the effects of different scenarios, such as changes in subsidy rates, on property values and community finances.",The analysis relies on ex-ante modeling.,"The paper discusses adaptation planning/decision-making through modeling shoreline management decisions made by communities in response to sea-level rise (SLR) over a long time horizon. The agent-based model (C-HOM) simulates these decisions in a coastal housing market context, examining the effects of SLR on real estate markets and incomes. The model also explores different scenarios, such as changes in subsidy rates for shoreline management.",,"The paper focuses on understanding the dynamics of coastal real estate markets under sea-level rise (SLR) using the Coastal Home Ownership Model (C-HOM). It does not directly address what constitutes a ""well-adapted"" level of adaptation. Instead, it models interactions between human and natural systems to analyze financial and environmental mechanisms influencing real estate markets and shoreline management. The paper implicitly suggests that sufficient adaptation might involve effective modeling and anticipation of market and environmental changes in response to SLR, as well as informed decision-making by coastal communities and stakeholders. However, the paper's primary emphasis remains on these models rather than defining or assessing sufficient adaptation levels.","No specific information on the benefits of ""soft options"" like informational and institutional interventions is provided.

The Pacific oyster industry in the Pacific Northwest has already suffered economic losses. Projections suggest that nationwide mollusk fishery losses could equal hurricane damage costs by the end of the century. While the economic effects on some reef systems are unexplored, their broader environmental value is significant. Adaptation strategies, collaborative knowledge production, and updated marine management systems are crucial to mitigating the impacts of ocean acidification on both marine ecosystems and human communities. Conservation and restoration efforts aimed at carbon sequestration could offer indirect benefits. Reduced biodiversity caused by acidification diminishes ecosystem resilience and regulating services.","Ocean acidification poses significant biological risks to marine life, particularly fish, by affecting their physiology and neurosensory processes through disruptions in CO2 levels and GABAA signaling.

The analysis uses monthly and quarterly data from 1995-2019, covering 70 3-digit NAICS industries and 78 counties. The methodology exploits county-time, county-industry-time, and industry-time variation, incorporating various fixed effects and controls. A hurricane exposure index, based on windspeeds derived from HURRECON and Depperman's formulas and potentially using EM-DAT data, is used as the exogenous shock. Impulse Response Functions (IRFs) are generated to examine effects over different time horizons (up to 24 months). Robustness checks include using different exposure measures, specifications, and input-output linkages. Linear interpolation and Newey-West corrected standard errors are also used. Industries are classified into Strengthened, Neutral, or Weakened categories.","Hurricanes have a statistically significant, but temporary, negative impact on overall employment, peaking around six months post-event. However, these impacts are heterogeneous across industries.

This heterogeneity exists even within 2-digit sectors. Input-output linkages appear to be a key transmission mechanism, as seen in the construction sector's positive response. Adaptability-driven employment resilience, involving worker reallocation from contracting to expanding industries, is a potential building block for post-disaster resilience, achievable through vocational training programs. Hurricane Maria (2017) in Puerto Rico, serves as a notable case study, highlighting the substantial economic impact of hurricanes.
