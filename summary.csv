A PDD-based scheme calculates surface mass balance, while PICO and plume models estimate sub-shelf melt rates. The analysis distinguishes atmospheric and oceanic forcings' separate impacts and uses uncertainty analysis through Latin hypercube sampling.","Ocean warming is identified as the primary driver of short-term mass loss in Antarctica, with atmospheric warming shifting from mitigation through snowfall to amplifying mass loss through increased surface runoff under very high-emissions scenarios, potentially leading to a collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Projections highlight significant uncertainties in ice-sheet evolution driven by interactions between oceanic and atmospheric forces, with the Antarctic contribution to global mean sea-level rise depending heavily on future emissions paths, showing potentially substantial divergence beyond the 21st century.","The study uses the Kori-ULB ice-sheet model, calibrated with CMIP5 data but forced by CMIP6 climate models, to project Antarctic ice sheet changes. The model employs multiple sub-shelf melt parameterizations and explores uncertainties in ice-ocean and ice-atmosphere interactions. Mass loss is primarily driven by oceanic forcing, particularly in the Amundsen Sea Embayment, with continued Thwaites Glacier retreat predicted even under present-day conditions. Under a very high emission scenario (SSP5-8.5, acknowledged as unlikely on multi-century timescales), a critical warming threshold leads to increased surface runoff and accelerated mass loss, potentially resulting in West Antarctic ice sheet collapse. The model has limitations including coarse resolution, absence of a water-routing scheme, omission of the melt-albedo feedback, and computational constraints leading to the use of a standalone ice-sheet model with independent atmospheric and oceanic boundary conditions.

The least changes occur under SSP126, while SSP585 leads to abundance increases for Pacific cod and decreases for snow crab, with corresponding shifts in their centers of gravity. Catches near Dutch Harbor may decline for valuable fisheries under SSP585 due to catch composition changes. Shifts in species distribution are minimal under SSP126 and significant under SSP370 and SSP585. Abundance declines are observed in the EBS for abundant cod and flatfish taxa, with increases in the Chukchi Sea, and opposite patterns for low vs. high economic value species. Maximum catch potential (MCP) increases in the Chukchi Sea are driven by low-value taxa. Economic impacts (MRP, MPP) are most significant late-century under SSP585. Increases in MCP do not necessarily translate to increases in MRP and MPP. High greenhouse gas emissions (SSP585) can lead to economic impacts, potentially from the loss of high-value taxa. Redistribution of fishery resources could lead to governance and management issues, fisheries conflicts, overexploitation risks, ecological shifts, and altered predator-prey dynamics. Limited economic impact is expected in well-managed ecosystems under low to moderate climatic changes in the near-term (2021–2040), but mitigation strategies are needed as climate change intensifies.","Study projects abundance and distribution changes in the eastern Bering and Chukchi Seas under different SSPs (including extreme SSP585), highlighting potential impacts on commercial/subsistence fisheries, trans-boundary resource management, and fishing fleet mobility, while acknowledging limitations from simplified biological/economic assumptions, limited species subset, and machine learning models.",Chronic trends,Adaptive,Regional,,Transitional (accounting for changes over time),,"Adaptation is not explicitly modeled.
